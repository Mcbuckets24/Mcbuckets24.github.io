    <h2>Koe no Katachi and Learning to Live</h2>
<p>Koe no Katachi is the most important story I’ve ever read. I first watched the movie in July 2020 when I was in seventh grade and as I rewatch and reread it almost five years later it hits and changes me all over again. Nothing I’ve ever seen or read has captured what it feels like to be human better than this series. It’s a story that taught me how to live. It showed me that it’s okay to exist. I love this story because it taught me how to love myself.</p>
<p><i>**There’s so many things I want to touch upon and look at, so I’m sorry if this gets a little messy along the way. Sometimes it may be formal
    and sometimes it may just be straight rambling. Perspective will probably be a mess. I’ve never been more excited to write something, but the
    ideas have yet to fall into one line, so things may be a little odd. I apologize, but I hope it conveys how deep my love for this series is and
    all the ways I try and show why that is.</i></p>
<p>Probably the biggest reason for my love for the series, outside of its quality, is my time of consumption. I really think that the time in which you consume a story plays so much into how much of an effect it has on you. For me, when I first watched the film, it was the first summer after a year where my life really changed. My larger perception of life had dramatically altered, and not exactly in a bad way, but it left me a little lost. I wasn’t fully sure of myself, not that I really am now, but this story helped me find solace in that fact. Koe no Katachi taught me what my social anxiety was. I had always experienced social anxiety, but I didn’t really understand why or where it came from. The film’s representation of social anxiety especially, was a sort of revelation for me. It was the first time where I had ever seen my feelings expressed in such a way. It wasn’t something that I was really aware other people felt, but when I saw it depicted through Shoya’s eyes I felt found. It made me feel that I wasn’t alone and that someone else out there understood my struggle. Shoya’s story, while most definitely not eliminating my social anxiety, has helped me to find a sort of acceptance. Yes, I should work harder on it and try to improve myself, but I feel that through this story and my own personal convictions, I’ve made progress in my battle against social anxiety. This story taught me that even if others think it's easy or are confused by your anxiety, it's okay to have those feelings and it’s the effort you make to step beyond those fears that is important.</p>
<p>This all takes me to today, where the story relates to me still for those same reasons, but in a new way entirely that I didn’t expect. Something not really included in the film, but a major part of the manga, is Shoya and Shoko’s decisions on university and their respective fears of the future and leaving home. As I write this now I’m less than 5 months away from graduating high school, and these feelings really connected with me. It’s something that subconsciously this story has helped me to overcome. I’m going to have to move away for college and leave my entire life and friends that I’ve built at home behind. And to be honest somewhere deep down I’m terrified. But in a similar way to how he helped me with my social anxiety, seeing Shoya experience those same emotions and find his own strength to make the decision best for him shows me that it’s possible. Shoko’s journey feels similar to mine. She moves to the big city with all new fears and people around her trying to hold her back, not out of malice, but out of worry. I feel both sides of that coin. I have that worry myself, but I also feel the drive to chase what I know is out there. Shoko’s strength inspires me to live out my own life and for that I can only thank this story and how powerful its messaging has been in the last 5 years of my life.</p>
<p>I don’t know if the person writing this today is sitting here without this story. I’ve never been suicidal, but I’ve definitely felt the want to disappear, to just have never existed in the first place. I don’t want to make it seem like I’ve gone through the same struggles these characters have. I believe all trauma is solely experienced first hand. I can’t speak on how what I dealt with compares to others. All I can say is that through this story I was able to find comfort and confidence in the proof that life is always meaningful and never to be wasted.</p>
<h2><strong>Part 1: Learning to Listen</strong></h2>
<p>“The caterpillar is a prisoner to the streets that conceived it”</p>
<p>When re-reading the beginning of the story depicting Shoya’s bullying of Shoko honestly was hard to read. It really pained me to see it again and it helped me come back to the central theme that I think really underscores what the entire series is all about. An inability to understand. Whether in this instance it means literally in regards to language, or later in regards to one’s feelings and personal trauma. I’ve seen people criticize the depiction of Shoya and their feelings that he was an unredeemable main character. And while I do think in the moment when you are seeing the bullying it feels sickening, his journey really cements how profound the story of change in this series is as despite his previous actions, everyone finds their own way of forgiving him. His childlike naivete is sad to see on reread as you know how much these actions will haunt him in his later life even when in the moment he doesn’t feel it really means anything. Every interaction he has with Shoko is marked by this fear to understand her. Even when she continuously tries to forgive him and ask for his friendship.</p>
<p>As someone who was raised to always be accepting of and accommodative of disabled due to familial history, seeing the layers of structure failing in Shoko’s past really hurt me. From the bullying to teacher incompetence and a general sense of fear that hangs over everyone involved makes the whole situation only harder to watch. The scene that I feel most exemplifies the insecurities and failures of everyone in the class is the one in which Ms. Kita proposes that the class should learn sign language in order to better communicate with Shoko. Naoka initially rejects the idea due to selfishness and her insecurity, to which Ms. Kita attempts to explain how it will help Shoko and contribute to an overall better class environment and relationship. Then both Noaka and Mr. Takeuchi fire back with the selfish reasoning that still haunts conversations of disadvantaged people to this day “why should it matter to me”. Something that will be brought up again later in the story, but a moment that exposes the self-absorbed attitude that exudes from all these characters as they look at Shoko as a burden to themselves rather than someone in need of help that can be guided to a greater future. The incompetence of the teacher really irks me everytime, as in a failure to realize the larger implication of the situation he calls out the fact that Ms. Kita doesn’t already know sign language herself, and thus has no right teaching it. He fails to acknowledge how helping others can come sometimes at a small sacrifice for one self, and that often it requires change beyond one’s own comfort zone. Something that defines the story’s larger arc.</p>
<p>“Its only job is to eat or consume everything around it, In order to protect itself from this mad city”</p>
<p>Even as Shoya is ostracized himself and is only left with Shoko’s attempts to help him, he continuously rejects her. His fear of genuine understanding and change plagues his ability to form connections and move forward. Shoya’s class turns the isolation he inflicted upon Shoko onto him after he is called out for being a bully. When receiving this hatred, rather than fighting back, he eventually accepts and internalizes it. His class initially served as external punishment, but it sadly evolves into self-imposed ostracization due to his belief that he is unworthy of any form of attention or respect. Shoya forms a new identity based on self-hatred and guilt. It is here where I see and the comparison I want to make between the two stories as the construction of “These Walls”.</p>
<p>I think that in an interpretive sense <em>To Pimp A Butterfly</em> and A Silent Voice share a similar story, one of self-doubt, hatred and depression. They depict the cycles of guilt and self-imposed isolation that drive them further into despair. Kendrick and Shoya share common thought processes and ultimately find themselves both through social connections and self-acceptance. They both find their redemption through community and find the strength within themselves and the others around them to accept their pasts and build new futures. They’re stories of learning to love oneself and the arduous journey that often haunts that journey. They struggle with their own acceptance of guilt and their acknowledgement that they deserve the redemption that they find in the people they love.</p>
<p>“These Walls” was the first track that I felt mirrored this journey. I think it applies to many other characters throughout the series and I may expand upon that later, but Shoya’s example is the most obvious. Shoya’s “Walls” are the x’s he places upon the faces of others. A legitimate wall between him and others, representing Shoya’s refusal to forgive himself and prolong his self-imposed isolation. The walls surrounding Shoya trap him inside his mind, he can’t escape from the constant guilt that he feels he deserves. The walls in Kendrick’s song are a metaphor for the walls of a mental and physical prison, and the walls for Shoya represent the same thing. Shoya’s mental prison of hatred and the physical prison that he views school as due to the trauma he incurred and caused in his previous years. Both Shoya and Kendrick’s walls stop them from accepting the assistance and forgiveness of others. From Shoko’s initial extension of kindness in childhood and her later forgiveness of Shoya when they reunite are both rejected by Shoya’s internal self doubt. Shoya’s walls protect him, but they also isolate him. The song says “If your walls could talk, they'd tell you it's too late Your destiny accepted your fate”, this idea is exemplified by Shoya’s actions. He makes no attempts to improve himself or reach out to others. When the opportunities do arise, he is quick to make sure he is framed as the villain and assumes himself as a burden. Shoya believes the rest of his life should be spent atoning for what he did wrong. He even tries to end his own life, but it is then when his walls finally begin to deteriorate with his reintroduction to Shoko.</p>
<h2><strong>Part 2: Speaking With Actions</strong></h2>
<p>“While consuming its environment, The caterpillar begins to notice ways to survive”</p>
<p>Shoya’s first interaction with Shoko years after she left his school is one of my favorites in the entire series. It does so well to showcase Shoya’s self-deprecating attitude through his negative speech patterns along with the way the story takes cuts from the conversation to Shoya’s thoughts about how it's all a mistake and how he should’ve just jumped off a bridge. Shoya’s brain knows he is making a real connection, but his anxiety and regret tries hard to reject the idea and make him feel unworthy.</p>
<p>This scene also showcases an interesting parallel between Shoko and Shoya and the ways in which they attach themselves to their pasts. Shoko jumps into the river after her notebook, a notebook that represents the pain she endured when she was younger. Shoya chases after her, developing the importance of the bridge as a motif for connection. Shoya does decide to jump off a bridge that day, but it is not out of a desire to die, but rather a desire to keep living for the thing he is chasing: Shoko. Both characters remained chained and burdened by their pasts. Shoko refuses to let go of the hurt that she blames herself for. She reflects the pain that the marginalized often feel as they feel as though they are the problem rather than the people who are wronging them. Shoko chasing after her notebook represents the way that she holds on to that hatred. The notebook only contains pain and hurtful things that others said to her. Shoko choosing to jump in the water in order to save it shows how she has attached herself to that internalized blame; just like Shoya, she feels that her guilt over her past is something that she needs to remember and will never be able to move past. While she hides those feelings behind a simple smile, and does seem genuinely happy to see Shoya, her character flaws are often expressed through metaphorical or physical actions rather than her speech or inner thoughts in the way Shoya’s is due to her disability. The ability to not understand her emotions and thought processes extends to not only the characters of the story, but the reader as well.</p>
<p>This more interpretive understanding is one way Shoko’s initial present day character is established, but her given reason for her retrieval of the notebook also says a lot about who she is. She tells Shoya that “I gave up once before, but since you brought it back to me.” To me this represents what is literally written on the cover of the notebook “Communication Notebook”. Shoko, like Shoya had given up on communicating and connecting with others, but when Shoya makes a move to reestablish that connection she, like Shoya, uses it as an opportunity as another chance at life. They both approach their relationship as a way to refind their place in the world and establish new meaning. While it results in some unhealthy reliance on one another from both ends, it is a necessary connection that both of their characters need in order to get themselves off the ground and back into social circles.</p>
<p>Another topic that is introduced in this scene that is later expanded upon, but something that I really latched onto this re-reading was the implications of “see you”. It’s a simple phrase that is often said without any other thought behind it, but it carries the simple idea that this is not goodbye, but rather a temporary separation. I don’t know if it came from this series or was just something I always did, but “see you” was always my goodbye of choice. It implies that the relationship is valued and that you plan to continue talking and forming new connections. For Shoya, he also picks up on this idea as he mulls over what she really meant by “see you”. “Later, When is ‘later’”. It’s this overthinking of simple interactions that really indicates that Oima really understands what social anxiety feels like. The constant pressure that exudes from Shoya in his early conversations, and the doubt over what he says and how he reacts to things. Social anxiety is often complex and unfounded, but the feelings find their way to seep into every thought that regards others.</p>
<p>“What is friendship?” Shoya’s distance from any attempt to form friendships leaves him confused and doubting the reality that he and Shoko can really be friends. This is where Tomohiro’s influence helps Shoya develop his feelings and rebuild the confidence that he needs to really reach out to Shoko. He says “I think friendship is something deeper than words or logic” this line really spoke to me. Friendship is something that is so undefined, for people with social anxiety, it can often feel one-sided or undeserving in Shoya’s case. Nobody goes out and states that they’re friends, it’s something that you just feel. The wording in specific is clever as Shoko doesn’t use verbal words to communicate, so the notion that it is “deeper than words” helps Shoya to realize that he and Shoko don’t need to openly express their friendship in order for the two of them to feel it between one another. His initial attempt to confirm his beliefs is rejected by Yuzuru’s protection of her sister, but Shoko makes that extra effort to ensure they get to talk. Something that is often needed with people with social anxiety as it is very easy to be discouraged and give up on social interactions due to your mind's self-doubt. I’ll touch more on Yuzuru and the ways in which she builds walls around Shoko in order to do what she perceives as “protecting” her later when it becomes more apparent, but I just wanted to note how real Yuzuru’s care for her sister feels even from her first appearance. The entire Nishimiya family has a lot to develop on, but I’ll try to keep this essay as chronological as I can in order to better organize my thoughts and keep myself from going on tirades.</p>
<p>One of my favorite scenes in the entire series comes when Miyoka Ishida, Shoya’s mother, confronts him in a casual conversation about his suicide attempt. I love the raw emotion displayed by a loving mother who has done so much for her son and consistently makes such great efforts to help him on top of supporting a pretty large family. Shoya’s mother teaches him the consequences of his actions when her earring is pulled out by Yaeko Nishimiya, Shoko’s mother, communicating to Shoya that his actions have negative effects on his loved ones, which he then develops into this idea of doing nothing in order to protect himself and his family. But regarding the previous scene on re-watch of the movie it really had me tearing up. The emotions were so real, and as someone whose life was dramatically changed by suicide, anything relating to the topic gets me emotional. But this is a greater testament for why I love this story as when suicide is treated wrong, it often ruins my enjoyment of something. While this isn’t the last time it will be brought up in the story and in this essay, I wanted to really commend Oima and her ability to communicate how hard those feelings are to deal with. The burning of the money feels to me like the feeling that one gets after a tragedy and how the value of monetary or materialistic items feel meaningless. The money doesn’t matter anymore, because one’s life will always take priority over any other reason fathomable. It represents a short reminder that you are always first and foremost, it's so easy to get swept up in your worries and anxieties, but at the end of the day you must always remember that you are loved and that the people who love you will always support and fulfill you.</p>
<h2><strong>Part 3: A Conversation Begins</strong></h2>
<p>“One thing it noticed is how much the world shuns him, But praises the butterfly”</p>
<p>Shoya and Shoko’s literal distance and continued communication issues are displayed on the train ride where they stand on opposing sides of the doors. Two things I wanted to touch upon here, but I’ll point out the more personal thing first. The page where Shoya is just fiddling and unsure of how to talk to Shoko or uphold the conversation is way too relatable. Notably the yawn, that yawn has plagued so many of my conversations. It's just a little social anxiety tick and Shoko’s immediate reaction to it, reminds me of all the times I’ve done it and then I quickly thought “Oh, no I hope they don’t think they’re boring me”. It further illustrates Oima’s understanding of social anxiety, the all too strong intensity of eye contact, the itchy restlessness that comes when you don’t know what to say or how to keep others engaged. It all builds Shoya as a real person not a trauma prop or some flat misunderstood thought of what someone with trauma and anxiety should look and behave like. The other, more prevalent element of the scene calls back to the idea of the “Walls” and their physical presence between the two of them. But the thing this time is that it's not only Shoya’s walls but Shoko’s as well. They aren’t visible or as obvious as Shoya’s but the more you look for them, the clearer they are. The fact that she communicates to Shoya through text here rather than signing to him shows that she feels the same pressure that he is feeling, but just does a better job at masking it. An important aspect of her character that contributes to everyone’s inability to really understand her feelings. The entire scene really just serves to repeatedly enforce the distance between their understanding of one another and their inability to communicate through various symbolic references. Shoya’s obliviousness to Shoko’s internal struggle, and something that even foreshadows Shoko’s suicide attempt comes when the distance between the two of them slowly increases as Shoya mindlessly walks farther and farther away from Shoko as she chases after him, desperately trying to get him to understand her.</p>
<p>This then begins the complicated series of interactions with Shoya and the rest of his old friend group. The first one to re-enter the story is Miyoko, likely the best influence on Shoya and his mindset. Her positive impact comes from the last thing she says to Shoya after he confesses his bullying to her that “It’s okay Shoya. Since Shoko was smiling, I’ve decided to smile too.” It's a line that tells Shoya that it's okay to forgive himself. That the pain he caused can’t be forgotten, but his current actions can work to counteract that pain and work towards a positive change for himself and the one he hurt. While that message doesn’t fully make it into Shoya’s brain and make him change his self-perception, it serves as something to remember in the background which can be all the difference when you struggle to trust even your own voice. The negative aspect of Miyoko’s return comes from the aspect of their interactions that he actually does take to heart. The positive and seamless interactions that she is able to have with Shoko. Shoya sees this and only criticizes himself for not being able to do the same. Communication is difficult and when others make it look so easy it is often discouraging to those who don’t find it so effortless. Shoya only multiplies his guilt over feelings that he is an inferior and inadequate friend for Shoko. He sees his old friends as this unreachable goal of perfection that hurts his progress. Shoya always frames himself in the perspective of others, when his circumstance is exclusive and should be evaluated through his experiences alone.</p>
<p>Shoya attempts to move forward with his life, attaching a new purpose to something that once felt meaningless. His unaddressed trauma from childhood consistently creates holes in his relationships with others. He lashes out at Shoko and Tomohiro from the smallest provocation; it signals his weakness and inability to truly face his past. He tries to use Shoko as a mechanism to escape his trauma and try to help somebody else overcome theirs instead. By attaching his purpose to Shoko he feels as if it supplies him with enough responsibility to keep living, but it fails to give him the true purpose that he desires in his life. Shoya tries to disassociate himself from his past and guilt, by “saving himself” he neglects his need to reflect and make changes for the better. Shoya treads towards a dangerous path of a refusal to learn and change, a lifestyle that would leave him unfilled and likely in the same palace he started if he is unable to assess his past trauma and make himself better for it. It’s only his coincidental run-in with Naoka that reminds him that you can’t outrun the past. Naoka’s reintroduction serves as his biggest test of judgement in the series thus far. It’s the moment that tests his ability to weigh Shoko’s interests against his own. While somewhere inside him he wants to forgive Naoka due to the fact that they used to be friends, and also due to the fact that he sees a little bit of himself in her. Shoya subconsciously recognizes that if he were to outright ignore and reject Naoka, then he himself doesn’t deserve the chance at redemption that Shoko is giving him. Naoka, like the rest of Shoya’s friend group, represents a parallel version of him. She represents what Shoya could have become if he never regretted his actions. If he had lived out the rest of his life without ever reflecting on his past. A life built upon repressed emotions and trauma, but one that from the outside seems more appealing than the one he lives himself.</p>
<p>Shoya initially displays his growth and the ways in which his mental state has progressed past that of Noaka’s on their next interaction, when she forces him into a conversation and confronts Shoko for the first time since sixth grade. Shoya stands firm in his beliefs and outright rejects Noaka’s attempts at provocation, displaying his newfound growth and refocused morals and purpose. But much of that growth is undermined through his inability to understand others emotions. From Naoka’s blatant attempts to get him to notice she likes him, to him refusing to tell Shoko what Noaka said to him. It shows his lack of commitment to a full change, while his mind is in the right place, he still fails to fully communicate with Shoko and those around him, leading to more problems and self-doubt. Shoya’s insecurities are once again exposed when he becomes hung up on Noaka’s comment that he and Shoko are only “pretend friends.” His emotions are easy to understand as it's easy to undermine one’s own connection with others, but it ties back to what Tomohiro said before. Friendship is not simply defined, and Noaka’s attempts to drag Shoya away from Shoko and back to her should pass him by without a thought, but his flawed personality causes him to get caught up in it. He once again doubts Shoko’s real care for him. It serves as a reinforcer of Shoya’s self-sabotage, the story can’t simply let Shoya conquer his anxieties after one simple conversation, because the story is real. Real anxiety and trauma can’t be overcome with a couple words, it requires hard work, it's often demoralizing and difficult, it causes one to fall back on bad habits and encourages self-loathing. All things exhibited by Shoya, he’s a character based in reality, one with a realistic experience, and one whose journey feels authentic and encouraging as a reader.</p>
<p>For most of the story, Noaka is used to drive conflict in the plot, and deal harm to Shoya’s progress. She represents the fact that in reality there are often people who are bad influences upon you, people who like you for who you were and not who you want to be. Shoya’s story with her is one of acceptance. Throughout the story, Naoka doesn’t undergo any massive character change, Shoya learns to accept her for who she is and how to take her genuine side for what it is, while ignoring her ill-natured side. Naoka is stuck in what was, unable to move forward with new eyes. She loved Shoya for who he was when they were children, and when faced with his current self, she finds it impossible to forgive herself for abandoning him, instead placing the blame upon Shoko for creating the tear in the first place. Naoka’s internal struggle is expanded upon a little later so I’ll touch on her again there, as I believe she is one of the most important characters in the story, but in the meantime there’s a scene that I’ve been waiting to talk about for five years.</p>
<p>Shoko’s confession to Shoya is really special. This was the first scene in the film that made me cry the first time I watched it. Back then, I hadn’t cried to a piece of media in a very long time. Not since those sad movies you watched as a child, that make everyone cry. This was really the first time in my life where I found something so moving that I couldn’t help myself from crying. Now I cry a lot more when watching and listening to things, is that good? Some might say no, but I think it is. It builds a stronger attachment to the things I love, and what's the point of living if you can’t truly care about the things that make you passionate. The tears I felt when I first witnessed this were changing, they showed me the power of storytelling, something that really changed my life. The ability to communicate meaning and struggle through simple visuals and audio. I’m proud to say that Koe no Katachi has made me cry more than any other piece of media in my life. The emotions I feel from this are special, it’s a feeling of understanding and love. I cried for Shoko not because I related to her experience, but simply because I felt that I finally understood her. The film is created in a way that watchers kind of follow Shoya though his attempts to understand Shoko. She feels so distant, unreachable, and desperate for connection. I’ll try to dissect it in the next paragraph, but this scene finally tells the reader who Shoko is. It explains her feelings, the way she thinks, and why she behaves the way she does. Emotion is often shamed, especially in male spaces, but here I was told that it’s okay to cry. That when emotions are felt in the right way, crying is rewarding. To me it symbolizes connection and power, it’s the only real physical resonance of emotion, and it taught me that this story was more than a simple movie or manga, it was something that would change my life, and something that I would never forget. Never be afraid to cry, you are strong and loved, your tears show that you care.</p>
<p>Shoko Nishimiya. There’s so much to unpack in her confession scene, but I’ll try and take it one step at a time. First the ponytail. This one really stumped me, while it clearly symbolizes a desire for change and a new step in life, I felt like I was missing something. And to be honest I’m still not sure of it. Is it simply an attempt to impress Shoya, to get him to finally take real interest in her, something for them to talk about? Does it symbolize the fragility of the front she puts on? The fact that even with the ponytail, Shoya is still unable to fully understand her. Personally I like to lean towards the idea that the Shoko presented to Shoya in this scene is an illegitimate version of herself. One that caters to what society demands of her. She ties her hair back and tries to speak without signing. It represents what Shoko wishes her life could be like. A normal life, one where her feelings are acknowledged, where she can openly express herself and have others appreciate her confidence. But even if that is the world she wishes for, sadly it's not the one she lives in. In this scene, Shoko still views herself and her disability as a burden to those around her. While what she fails to see is that her disability is part of what makes her special. It may require her to communicate in “unnatural” forms or act differently than others, but it doesn’t mean that it isn’t her. Shoko isn’t defined by disability, but it is still an important part of what makes her herself.</p>
<p>More to this idea is the fact that she insists on speaking to Shoya aloud rather than through sign language. To me, this had two meanings, first the one already discussed, her attempts to conform to society’s and her own beliefs of what she should be, and second Shoko’s attempt to truly be “heard”. Oima uses spoken voice as a metaphor for being heard and understood. Through sign language, Shoko feels that the people around can understand what she is saying, but they are unable to feel it. Shoko feels this most in her interactions with Shoya. Due to his self-inforced distance and anxiety along with his general inability to understand the feelings of others, whether by choice or a simple aspect of his character. Shoko’s spoken speech inevitably backfires on her in her attempt to pronounce “好き” which is misunderstood as “つき”. Resulting in Shoya failing to hear Shoko’s confession, and a failure to finally bridge the gap between the two of them.</p>
<p>Speaking of bridges, the bridge is the most common and recurring setting and symbolic device in the entire series. It marks the two’s meeting place and essentially the location of almost every important scene in the manga. While the bridge normally symbolizes the attempts at connection between the two, here it communicates the continued distance from each other. As Shoko tries to confess her feelings to Shoya, he stands at the opposite side of the bridge, even facing in the opposite direction. It all calls to Shoya’s continued fear of truly understanding Shoko. It comes from a place of self-preservation, as he knows facing his past in its entirety is likely going to hurt him. The shallowness of the connection the two share now protects him. He knows that really getting to know her is for the best, but his anxiety tells him that it's not worth it. He blames it all on his younger self, failing to recognize that the problem lies with himself in the present. While the actions of his child self are what caused the situation, the Shoya of today has to live with that decision and put in the effort to make right of it and move forward in a positive manner. Reibeck really said it all, “The past is past, now, but that’s… you know, that’s okay! It’s never really gone completely. The future is always built on the past, even if we won’t get to see it. Still, it’s um, time for something new, now.” Whether it be yours or Shoya’s past it's never going to go away, all you can do is acknowledge and understand its reason and work to look ahead in a way that incorporates what you learned from it into the new person you become.</p>
<p>The exact panel I wanted to dive further into is the one where Shoya drives a knife through the body of his younger self, saying “Ahhhhh I wanna kill him! I want to kill the old me.” This panel really fueled my initial ideas for the TPAB parallels in the series. To me it screams the same messaging as “u” and their respective journeys to “i”. Shoya sees himself as two different people in this scene; he views his old self as a unique personality, rather than an extension of himself. Here and throughout so much of the series, especially in the earlier parts, Shoya sees himself as “u”. The idea of U represents one's self-hatred, referring to oneself as you indicate a distance from one’s own identity. It’s often laced with ideas of blame and doubt. Your brain tells you that it’s your fault, separating your actions from your actual thoughts. Kendrick says that “Loving you is complicated”, showing his inability to express self-love over his guilt and fears. Shoya exhibits these same ideas. Shoya hates himself, he hates who he used to be and tries to distance himself from the fact that that was part of him by viewing it as a separate identity. Shoya can’t accept himself for who he is, and it's that fact that inhibits his growth into someone he can truly be proud of. The song ends with the line that “money can’t stop a suicidal weakness” and it’s a similar idea to one that hangs over the series in its entirety. That no matter what one is given or told, a suicidal idealogy is extremely difficult to overcome. It can only be defeated by the individual themselves. Outside help and support is important, but at the end of the day it comes down to one’s own drive to improve themselves and find a reason for living. Kendrick and Shoya’s journeys, while different in reason, are the same in ideology. One of overcoming self-hatred, finding a purpose bigger than oneself, and utilizing that purpose to find meaning and create a better version of who they once were.</p>
<p>This scene is indispensable to the series. It’s the most obvious occurrence of, and the larger reflection of the distance between the two being able to feel the emotions of the other, and it's the moment where the reader finally gets a more comprehensive understanding of Shoko’ struggle. While it's made pretty obvious to anyone reading that Shoko likes Shoya from basically the start, it’s the layered attempts Shoko makes to appeal to and be understood by Shoya that depict her feelings. It becomes clear from her actions that this kind of misunderstanding has plagued Shoko her entire life. Nobody besides Yuzuru really gets Shoko. It all ties back to her introduction, the communication notebook. The abstract nature in which she communicates and the inability for others to understand her pain and its cause. Shoko is isolated from her very first appearance, while she always wears a smile on the outside it abundantly clear that Shoko’s desire for connection is just as great if not assuredly larger than Shoya’s. Shoko summons the courage to finally express herself, but it's in Shoya's failure to comprehend it that her feelings of isolation and burdenism are only reinforced driving her deeper into her depression that only through this scene can really start to be seen. It's a reminder that people are so much more than what appears on their face or what they say, there’s a complex network of memories and feelings that drive every action, so just remember to always be accommodating and make the effort to understand the struggle of others as much as possible, even when it seems incomprehensible, because you never know when it could save somebody's life.</p>
<h2><strong>Part 4: Words of Reassurance</strong></h2>
<p>“The butterfly represents the talent, the thoughtfulness and the beauty within the caterpillar”</p>
<p>The fallout from the confession seems somewhat flat at first. While there are some initial reactions by Shoko in private, her interactions with Shoya don’t seem to change much beyond a little added distance. I think it speaks to how Shoko internalizes her pain and guilt. She furthers her burden and doesn’t ask anyone else for any help or input, she simply takes what happened and moves on believing herself to still be at fault.</p>
<p>The trip to the amusement park is really a turning point in Shoya’s thinking and behavior. His first thoughts after they meet up are very cynical, debating the aspects of his friends personalities and is quick to criticize their flaws. From Miki’s overconfidence and comfort, to Naoka and Miyoko’s revived friendship. Before riding the rollercoaster, a symbol for the fear tha Shoya feels in these social situations, the anxiety of putting oneself out into the world. Stepping beyond your comfort zone to interact with people that you may be afraid won’t see eye to eye. It’s something I’ve dealt with all too many times, and the emotions show through his evasiveness and the ways he initially outcasts himself from the group, staying quiet and isolating himself in his own thoughts and doubts over his place within the friend group. He finds the courage he needs to immerse himself in the moment and appreciate the situation for what is despite its flaws during his interaction with Miyoko where she tells him “I used to be too scared to ride this one. I figure I’ll wait until after the ride to decide if it’s scary.” The rollercoaster stands a pretty clear objective correlative for Shoya’s current mental state. He views this trip as an insurmountable obstacle, the way Miyoko once viewed the idea of riding a rollercoaster. The thought of doing it is often scarier than the actual emotions that spawn from the action. Once Shoya takes the initial dive into the situation, allowing himself to be emotionally open and accepting the compliments of his friends, he realizes in that moment that friendship doesn’t need to be earned, rather it is given through genuine interaction and connection greater than something words can express. Shoya experiences his first moment of genuine happiness in the series as he feels the weight of his previous actions lifted from his shoulder, instead viewing the present for what it is, not what made it possible. It doesn’t last long, but it teaches Shoya an important lesson about self-worth, that no matter what he thinks he is worthy of his life. That the people in his life are there because they like and respect him. There’s no outstanding sense of obligation or necessity; it's simply a love between friends, and while not flawless, it presents a future for Shoya not bound by guilt but promise.</p>
<p>Shoya’s progress is still built on fragile ideals though and that all comes out when he encounters Kazuki for the first time since sixth grade. The interaction is not the problem itself, but rather Shoya’s reaction to it. All he has to do, if he doesn’t want to reignite their friendship, is say hello and then turn and walk away. Not thinking anything more of it or dwelling on its implications, but instead he internalizes his guilt all over again. It brings back the painful memories, and makes him debate the nobleness of the reuniting of friends he’s been trying to do. Shoya feels the emotions that he has been all but forcing others to feel. When Noaka turns the table on the interactions though, Shoya realizes that his mission to reunite the sixth grade class has possibly been hurting Shoko more than helping her. While not entirely true, it's something that he takes to heart, feeling as if all the progress he has made was built upon some fake noble mission, when in reality it was a selfish attempt to help him find a reason to live. What he fails to realize though, is that even if all those things were true (which they aren’t), it’s okay. Shoya is trying to learn to live again, and that requires the help of others. To live alone is to live incompletely, and if Shoya were to try and complete his self-discovery alone, he likely wouldn’t make it. Shoya falls back on his suicidal idealogy, circling back to the ideas of “u” and how debilitating that mindset can be. His “walls” are rebuilt higher than before, Shoya becomes trapped in his own cycle of torment.</p>
<p>This moment isn’t the end for Shoya or really something that pushes him in one direction or the other. It reminds him of the fragility of happiness. It can come and go in a moment, but the memory of those moments is what allows him to keep going. The entire scene leaves Shoya with a sense of uncertainty. He feels that reuniting with his old friends is his path to his own redemption and future, but it consistently brings him mental distress and doubts. He doesn’t make any progress in finding himself, his reason, or his ability to move on, but what he does find is that happiness is attainable. It doesn’t last long, but it's a reminder for him that all the effort isn’t worthless and though the renewed life he is trying to live, he can find love that he needs.</p>
<p>Noaka and Shoko’s confrontation on the ferris wheel operates in a similar fashion to Shoko’s confession on the bridge. While the nature of the conversation is obviously different, it is used as a means to Shoko’s internalized guilt, and for the first time in the series challenge her viewpoint. Noaka’s hostility and forwardness comes from her externalization of her own guilt. As noted earlier, Noaka never reflects upon herself, rather she always blames others for the bad things that happen to her. Noaka is extremely insecure and hung up on her love for Shoya, which blocks her ability to realize why they are unable to connect in the first place. But even if she tries to ignore it, the mind always finds a way to get its point across. Noaka’s struggle comes out when she slaps Shoko. It comes after Shoko tells her that she doesn’t hate her, but herself. It’s a honest moment from Shoko, and the first time thus far in the series where she openly expresses her own “suicidal weakness”. But when Noaka hears this it refutes everything she just tried to say. Noaka formulated a whole argument on why they should hate one another and why it should be kept that way, but Shoko tells her the truth of the situation. Shoko hates herself, but it’s also a reminder for Noaka that she too hates herself. Deep down she knows her way of living is wrong, she knows that she should try and make a change, and it’s Shoya’s attempts to do exactly that that bring her back into his life. She knows that if Shoya is able to improve himself and move on from his past, she won’t be with him. She knows that that journey is one without her in its future. And that knowledge pushes Noaka to try and get Shoya to love her in the present, in their current lives, because if not now it’ll be never. Noaka is so often used as the catalyst for issues, but behind her use as a tool for plot development lies a lot of love and complexity. There’s a lot about Noaka that is communicated through her thought processes and mannerisms rather than his dialogue. In the film, she feels a little flat, largely irredeemable and harder to understand. The manga gives Noaka a lot of smaller time and shots that tell the reader so much about her. Shoya’s obliviousness doesn’t help her case, but I think behind all the annoyance and rudeness is a great character that says more about the two main characters than they are often able to communicate themselves.</p>
<p>To break a bit from the seriousness, I just wanted to talk about the scene after Shoya realizes Shoko’s self hatred, and his attempts to quell her feelings. He just comes in super upfront telling her all the different things he likes about her. I think it’s important that all the things he calls to are external though, as it expands upon the idea that he really doesn’t know anything about her despite his attempts to connect with her. The over-preachy ending too where he tells her that she’s a great person and that he’ll always be available for support is so coated with social anxiety too, I love it. This story, and this moment along with others I’ve spoken on and will refer to later, is one of those ones that really makes me feel called out. It’s something I run into so often, especially through text, is my sense of being overly helpful or projecting my own struggles to others. I and Shoya alike always want to be of aid, always want to do the right thing, but since when the time comes it’s often difficult to speak up, it’s moments like these that really communicate his love. Saying how you feel, let alone anything it all, can be so difficult, so to see him really standing proud and trying his best to let her know that he cares about her, despite its awkwardness, really makes me smile. Us losers with social anxiety are just trying to put ourselves out there and help people, so if you ever run into an encounter like this, know that it isn’t weird but rather an expression of care and love.</p>
<p>The following arc is what really inspired me to think about writing this essay in the first place. The death of Shoko and Yuzuru’s grandmother inspired the idea to realize that this story was something greater than a manga for me. Maybe it was the universal relatability of it, a reminder of how life can be taken at any moment, but for me, I think it was the way that the story enforces the humanity of all people. It’s not designed to make you feel any great amount of sorrow or grief for the grandmother. She’s introduced and passed away in essentially one chapter, but she serves a great means to reveal the family dynamic and the ways in which they all cope with their situation. She’s the mediator, and the only member of the family who fully understands the other members. Her daughter, flawed, afraid, and protecting the mother of her children. Yuzuru, someone who deflects her own issues, in order to try and help her sister. And Shoko is the byproduct of their misunderstandings, the hardest to reach, and the one who suffers from the rest of the family’s failures. Her passing sense represents the loss of the barrier between mainly Yuzuru and her mother. Without the mediator to dispel their arguments, they’re forced to face one another head on. To gain a true understanding of each other, not through the lens of Shoko but through a heart to heart. They both hide their true emotions behind protecting Shoko, but when finally forced to look inward, they find that maybe they aren’t as unalike as they previously believed.</p>
<p>Yuzuru tells her grandmother that “I want to know… what kind of people sis was around…what her world was like..because one day, I might regret not knowing.” It’s a feeling everyone’s felt before one usually felt after the death of somebody you knew. That regret that you should’ve done more, that you didn’t get or give everything you couldn’ve for them. It stands as a reminder to cherish the time you get to spend with others because whether it be due to death or simple distance, there will be a time when you never speak to that person again. Time is often too short in retrospect, but it’s the love that you give in the small moments that makes that time all worth it. Yuzuru knows that her sister is suicidal, and it’s that knowledge that stops her from being her own person. She’s so caught up with trying to save her sister that she often fails to notice her own growth or progress. Something that is often needed to help others. Before you can help someone else you must help yourself. Without her own two feet to stand on, Yuzuru can’t lead Shoko to the changes she wants to see. Her grandmother reminds her of this in her last moments, and it’s a final idea that changes Yuzuru’s central ideology and makes her the great character that she is.</p>
<p>(Sorry another social anxiety paragraph) When Shoya sees Yuzuru crying at the bridge and tries to call out to her, but fails, it cements Yoshitoki Oima’s understanding of social anxiety. This isn’t something I’ve ever seen called out before, the inability to yell. Somewhere along the line in my life, I just lost the ability to yell. It probably sounds corny or untrue, but I promise it’s real. I just can’t do it, whether it’s fear, anxiety, or something in between I don’t know, but seeing Shoya experience that same struggle really felt shocking. It’s the prime example of how I felt this story understood me better than any other. Yelling seems so simple, but when Shoya is faced with doing it in an important moment he is unable to. It’s something I’ve felt myself, it's really indescribable, it feels like you’re being held back by something, the words just won’t leave your mouth. Even alone I can’t do it, I fear I’ll never be able to get it back, but it's stories like this that show that social anxiety is not an eternal condition, it can be overcome, and the journey is not easy, but one that is possible.</p>
<p>Chapter 30: Support. Maybe the most well set up chapter in the entire series and one that shows that Shoya hasn’t been solely an observer, but has learned from his friends and the examples they set. It’s a testament to emotional openness and the importance of support. The reveal of the chapter is obvious to anyone half paying attention, but Shoya is overtly oblivious. But that trait of his doesn’t damage the scene or message applied here, rather it is used to show Shoya’s good nature despite his helplessness in understanding others emotions or hints. He knows that Yuzuru is hiding her emotions and sees first hand the front that she almost always has up. But when faced with that front, rather than pressing her to get her to talk, he gives her the support she needs in order to tell him herself. This chapter employs one of Koe no Katachi’s best devices, its parallels. It begins when Shoya takes Yuzuru to a food court, and directly imitates his and Tomohiro’s first hangout. He tries to bring the energy to the conversation, looking to cheer up Yuzuru over whatever he knows she was upset about. Her analogy with the creamer packets about the loneliness she feels after her grandmother's death calls to the simplicity of mind after a death. A return to simple thoughts about the nature of mortality and the way you spend your life. Almost everyone has lost a grandparent at some point in their life, it often comes as one of if not the first death you experience as a human. It’s life altering, and it feels as if it alters the very chemistry of your brain, but I think most people come out of it better than they went in. It’s an often guilty feeling that I get, knowing that in a way I profited personally from the death of another, but I like to think that it’s their way of giving one final gift. A love letter to you, allowing you to move on stronger, without them, but with their memory. Death often makes you feel empty, but what you realize is that that emptiness is often filled by the very person who made it empty in the first place. As called out by Shoya, with the support of others you can rebuild that emptiness with the memory and love of the people that you lost. Shoya does exactly what the title of the chapter implies; he doesn’t have any answers, so he gives what he can, support. That answer must often be found within oneself, but it’s through the love of others that the option of an answer is even plausible. It’s probably Shoya’s strongest moment in the entire series thus far, one where he displays his growth, and proves that his self-viewed redemption isn’t a lie but something he is actively working to achieve.</p>
<p>The dialogue following Yuzuru’s attempt to leave by herself is the exact moment I decided I was going to write this essay, and my second favorite line in the entire series.</p>
<p>“S: You were crying weren’t you?</p>
<p>Y: What, you saw that? It’s got nothing to do with you.</p>
<p>S: Yes it does.</p>
<p>Y: How’s it got anything to do with you?</p>
<p>S: Because I’d like to think it does. Because I don’t want to have any regrets.</p>
<p>Y: Then tag along for all I care.</p>
<p>S: Thanks.”</p>
<p>It’s a callback to two things, one the same as what Noaka told Shoya after slapping Shoko “It’s got nothing to do with you”, and Yuzuru’s comment in the previous chapter, “because one day, I might regret not knowing.” It ties this chapter as the most important one in the series so far, a signifier for growth for both Shoya and Yuzuru and the moment that finally lets Yuzuru let her guard down. As opposed to last time Shoya doesn’t lash out when told the matter has nothing to do with him, instead recognizing it as a defense mechanism and working to prove that his desire to help is reason enough to be worthy. What pushed him and Noaka away last time, instead brings him and Yuzuru closer. The fact that Shoya almost directly quotes what Yuzuru said tells her that he understands her pain. It shows her that he’s good natured and genuinely out for the best for both her and Shoko. It’s all said through her tears. Tears that tell more than any words ever could. They’re the purest form of emotion and one’s that indicate the feeling of being truly understood and loved. Something Yuzuru only ever felt from her dearly passed grandmother. No other words need to be said, because one tear can tell Shoya everything he needs to know. It’s a similar aspect of Shoya and Shoko’s dynamic, the idea that love is not expressed but rather felt. We never get an explicit confession, or action of love, there’s just a simple understanding between the two that their relationship is more than something that words could express. When Shoya realizes what has happened it doesn’t elicit any major reaction, but simply a realization. And for first time in the series, it feels like he genuinely understands another person. It’s my favorite chapter in the entire series, and one of my favorite manga chapters period. It’s the chapter that establishes Yuzuru as possibly my favorite side-character ever. And I hope I did just half of the justice it deserves.</p>
<p>The next chapter, although not as masterfully set up as its predecessor, excels in different ways that make it just as powerful as “Support.” Its opening pages are marked with the tragedy of the moment, as we finally see Yuzuru’s mother let down her walls for just a moment as she sheds the needed tears for her own mother. I’ve never lost a parent and can’t even begin to write about its implications so I’ll leave that all to someone more capable and worthy of its analysis. What it does show is her humanity. She is always painted as the cold, overbearing and controlling mother who tries to protect her daughter, but often goes about it in the wrong ways. This scene links back to what I was saying earlier, where tears communicate more than words ever could. You don’t need to hear her pain or understand why she treats her family the way she does. It’s clear from her tears, it’s a defense, a coping mechanism and her own way of trying to ensure a positive future for her children even if they may not feel the same way. When I see Ms. Kita show up, it reminds me of my own grandmother’s funeral. I’m not sure what the purpose of her being there really is, but maybe it’s just to display the outpouring of love that often comes from death. It was at my own grandmother’s funeral, where I really realized the power of death. People I never knew even existed came to pay respects, people who hadn’t seen my parents in 30 years. It’s a display of love greater than anything else, unbound by any kind of boundaries, death transcends beyond human comprehension, it’s something that elicits sympathy from everyone no matter the relationship. Ms. Kita says “Wow I'm impressed, Shoko. I can’t believe you aren’t crying. You sure are strong” and Shoya thinks “But there’s nothing wrong with crying.” I absolutely loved this. If it wasn’t clear enough, I’m a big proponent of crying. It’s healing, it’s release, and it’s love. It communicates your feelings, crying makes me feel better, it makes things feel like they matter and reminds me that I’m human. Never be afraid to cry, it’s your expression of yourself, embrace it.</p>
<p>Yuzuru’s grandmother’s letter to her is beautiful. Yuzuru rejects and deflects her explanations of her mother’s behavior, refusing to accept it, but once she fully predicts the funeral and Yuzuru and her mother’s hiding of their emotions she lets it all hit her. She lashes out, but it’s clear that she got the message. The letter is a call to the entire Nishimiya family to finally be open with their emotions, to let the tears flow, and confide in one another. To learn that it’s all love, that the actions that you thought were hurtful we're just misguided attempts at protection and love. It reminds me of what Kendrick Lamar said on “Mother I Sober”, “So listen close before you start to pass judgement on how he move, Learn how he cope.” To understand what somebody does you must first understand their struggles and ways in which they learned to live with those things. When Yuzuru hears that, she acts like she doesn’t believe it, but deep down she realizes what her mother has been doing. She gets that it wasn’t contempt, but support.</p>
<p>Yuzuru’s mother thanking Shoya for being friends with her daughter is all too similar to ideas I just discussed and touched on earlier. It’s the way in which the superficial boundaries drop when someone close to you dies. All the harbored hate for Shoya she has, is finally overlooked for the good he’s done for their family. It’s another moment of achievement for Shoya, a moment where his efforts are acknowledged and he’s reminded that it’s all worth it. It’s hard to forgive, but forgiveness can often lead to the best outcomes. Yaeko Nishimiya’s “walls” are finally broken down, and she accepts her present future and her daughters’ autonomy. She learns to let them live and experience the people around them in order to help themselves grow, rather than trying to protect them from the outset. A complex story of motherhood and the difficulties of trying to provide and raise children by yourself, a tragic one, but one that teaches that the relationship with a parent is never truly broken. If only you attempt to understand them. It is often difficult, but everyone has a reason for their actions. You just must first understand how they cope in order to understand how they treated you, because most times you’ll find a link between their hurt, their love, and the ways in which it was communicated to you.</p>
<h2><strong>Part 5: A Quiet Calm</strong></h2>
<p>“But having a harsh outlook on life, the caterpillar sees the butterfly as weak, and figures out a way to pimp it to his own benefits”</p>
<p>The story comes to a more narrow perspective from this point on. It’s heavily centered around Tomohiro’s movie and its production represents a sense of stability to Shoya’s life. Rather than the random series of events and wandering present previously in his life, Shoya now sees a clear goal in his life, and the accomplishment of that is something he views in the same vein as his self-discovery. The movie requires everyone to work together despite their past issues, it demands Shoya to accept everything about his situation and forces him to face the parts of himself that remain neglected.</p>
<p>Production’s first conflict comes from the personalities of the non-core members of the group, ie: Noaka, Miki and Satoshi. They’re the three characters who remain the most incomplete as of this point in the story. They have yet to make any changes, just older versions of who they used to be. People who haven’t addressed their past issues or made any attempt to address them. It doesn’t help that this piled on top of the fact that they are the loudest and most social of the group. When discussing the film in Shoya’s house there is a scene where the three of them begin to talk and drain out Shoya and Tomohiro. It’s a relatable feeling, the one where in the presence of a big personality you feel as if your chances of speaking or viewpoint is entirely ignored. As someone who is often quiet around others, it's a common occurrence. It comes with a sense of shame, and then one of guilt if anyone tries to forcibly include you when they notice you aren’t talking. But here, Shoya finds the strength to speak up, calling out their purposeful ignorance of Shoko’s role in the movie. It’s a direct callback to the beginning of the story, in the scene where Ms. Kita purposes learning sign language. If they don’t have to, why should they include her. They view her disability as a barrier to their own achievements. If they have to deal with her, then production will be slowed and the overall product will be worse. It’s an obnoxious view, but one that is used to reinforce their failure to change. The story reminds the reader that even as Shoya becomes better friends with them, they are still not good people. They retain ingrained biases and discrimination, and it is through Shoya that the series reminds its readers to stand up to those ideas. To not be afraid to speak when it matters most despite the looks people might give you when you say it. There’s nothing harder, but nothing braver in the world.</p>
<p>The next scene for how insignificant its reality is, surprisingly, was one that changed my perception of the story as a whole. It spotlighted an idea that after seeing the movie and reading the manga, I had never noticed. It was here, when Shoya places his hands on Shoko's shoulders, to which he receives a shocked reaction from her, that I noticed a pattern in the series. Shoko’s aversion to physical touch, specifically with Shoya and his hands. It’s not in your face and never mentioned outright by any of the characters, but it’s definitely there. This serves as the most obvious example as her reaction is very clear and Shoya feels badly afterward because of it. But at the very beginning of her reintroduction Shoko continuously avoids directly touching Shoya. It’s actually rather after their first meeting because in that first scene, Shoko actually summons a tremendous amount of courage and grabs Shoya’s hand. But what I initially thought was a discredit to my theory, actually works in the opposite sense. It operates as foreshadowing of the final scene of the manga, as well as a symbol for the sign for friendship of putting one’s hands together. But rather than two of Shoya’s hands it’s one from the both of them. But what separates this as a failure in friendship is the fact that Shoya doesn’t grab it back. They’re holding hands less than Shoko is grabbing his. It’s a reference to a moment they shared earlier in childhood where the same thing happened, but also another point of foreshadowing for Shoko’s suicide attempt instead. Maybe I’ve made it all up and it’s just a series of coincidences that I’m overanalyzing, but the way Shoko gets afraid any time she bumps into Shoya, the way she grabs his sleeve rather than his hands, all wreaks of her being afraid to touch his hands. Is it from their past bullying history, or is it just her being afraid to touch him because she likes him? I don’t know that’s for you to decide, my analytical brain wants it to be the former, but maybe it’s not. It doesn’t really matter because it all serves in effort to make the final scene as powerful as it is. We’ll get there once it’s time, but I wanted to point it out here as this was where I noticed it most.</p>
<p>Shoya’s return to his elementary school for filming permission is complicated for me. Satoshi always seemed like the weirdest character to understand for me, maybe since he’s the only one who wasn’t present during their childhood, but it makes his overall character narrative harder to pinpoint. I’ll try to expand on it when we get to his character specific chapter soon, but this scene is really his true introduction. Unknown to Satoshi, it deeply hurts Shoya, in a way that is necessary for him, but one that ends up crushing Shoya’s progress. Satoshi’s hate for bullies is a clear reflection of Shoya’s hate for himself. I mean he chimes in his head almost every time Satoshi says something about bullying, making sure to remind himself that he was one of those bullies that Satoshi hates so much. The school represents a site of trauma for Shoya, it brings back all his emotions and the memories. He doesn’t have the wisdom to avoid his doubts yet, or the courage to open up to Satoshi about his past. Leading to a pile up of negative feelings from this trip that are only compounded when he meets his old teacher. He’s a failure as an adult, a terrible teacher, and what awaits Shoya in his future if he doesn’t change. I think he’s supposed to represent a direct parallel to what Shoya’s life could become if he were to not have reached out to Shoko or have been able complete his journey the way he does by the end of the series. There’s a reason that they look so similar, side by side they look almost identical, and it’s all to the reader what a terrible person Shoya could have become. It’s the reason why, when Satoshi splashes water on Mr. Takeuchi, Shoya seems so bothered by it. It’s not because he likes Takeuchi in any way, but it’s the way that he views himself in the same lens that he views his old teacher. A heartless bully who fails to reflect on their issues, living a lie, ignorant to the pain they caused. Shoya is brave enough to stand up to him, not as brazen as Satoshi, but in his own way tells Takeuchi that he's wrong about the entire situation. Another exemplification of Shoya’s renewed identity and strength as he’s able to speak up even when sacred to do so. But a scene that should mark a moment of progress for Shoya is entirely reversed from not only the fact that Satoshi keeps repeating that he wants to beat up bullies and the people that hurt Shoko as he unknowingly threatens Shoya standing beside him, but also Shoya’s final thoughts on the event as a whole. When leaving, Shoko tells Shoya that “The teacher and school looked smaller than they used to” an entirely normal reaction to visiting an elementary school, but Shoya in response thinks “Maybe one day, I’ll be able to think the same way.” It’s a play on the idea of the size of the actual objects of the school, and the amount of space they occupy in Shoya’s brain. He remains unable to look past the events of his childhood despite his growth. His bullying experience feels just as large in his brain as it did when it was happening. He’s still trapped within the confines of the school, unable to leave it behind and move on. The scene as a whole establishes Shoya’s self-doubt making sure to not let readers think that Shoya is making too much progress just yet.</p>
<p>A small aside about another thing that makes Shoko quote at the end very important is it’s implication for her suicide attempt. I’ll of course cover it in more detail when it comes up, but I thought this was a good moment to analyze the anime and the ways in which it fails in comparison to the manga. This small scene does everything to show Shoko’s state of mind. By clearly contrasting it with Shoya’s point of view, it tells the reader that Shoko has moved on from her childhood and that Shoya’s bullying is not something that actively hurts her. This scene’s absence in the film, along with many others, causes the anime to fail in depicting the reason for Shoko’s suicide attempt. In the movie, it could be interpreted as a result of leftover trauma from her childhood bullying, a clear misinterpretation and distortion of the source material. The movie fails to depict Shoko’s growth in the way that the manga does so well. It leaves watchers unsure of Shoya’s redeemability if they were to judge the bully as the reason for her suicide attempt. Something that would ruin the story’s meaning and message. I love the movie for what it meant to me and the emotions that it can elicit, but as an adaptation it is a failure. The narrative’s most important minutia are left out, it comes off as a shallower version of the manga, not misunderstood, but plagued by the constraints of its runtime. Leaving it as something emotionally powerful, but not nearly as great as its manga counterpart.</p>
<p>Chapter 36 and Shoya’s mini conflict with Tomohiro is something I’m not entirely sure of. The conflict is a little forced and comes off very childish, which is part of the point, but even still, it feels as though it is forcibly inserted just to get its message across. Likely one of the weaker moments of messaging throughout the story, even though it’s a message that I really like. It concludes with Shoya happy to even have friends to fight over little squabbles with. A very real feeling, and one that’s really fun to feel in real life. It comes from humans' natural born friction, not everyone is going to have the same beliefs and ways of living as you, but it’s the ways in which those things crossover that creates friendship in the first place. The chapter as a whole feels like a sort of callback to the amusement park scene, where despite their differences, the group is able to enjoy themselves and find fun in each other’s discrepancies. Shoya is still readjusting to life with friends, his old habits are still there, but he’s making an active effort to live more positively through the people around him.</p>
<p>The following chapter marks the tragic collapse of Shoya’s defenses; everything he worked so hard to build up from his relationships to his mental state are all set up for ruin. It starts off by showing the reader where Shoya is in life. Miyoko and Yuzuru supporting his relationship with Shoko (even though somehow he’s dumb enough to not notice) and trying to push them closer. I always loved the way Yuzuru accepts Shoya as a viable partner for her sister and then actively does the opposite of what she originally did, going out of her way multiple times to try and set up positive opportunities for them to connect. It’s a really cute smaller narrative arc that supplements Shoya’s growth and works as good comedy for readers as Shoya remains oblivious. The whole thing is a moment of fun and happiness for Shoya and the reader, used to juxtapose the succeeding meltdown.</p>
<p>In this same chapter, Shoya also finds his meaning of happiness. A simple day where he’s not really involved at all, but he finds his joy in being able to help everybody else be happy. Shoko tells him that “Thanks to you, I’m having a fun summer”, it’s everything Shoya has wanted and makes him feel that he finally made good on his promise to atone for his past mistakes. By being able to insert happiness in her life now, he feels in some way that he has “made up” for the past. It’s this very ideology that causes all the following events. He’s too attached to Shoko’s mental state rather than his own. He looks for his purpose in making others happy, when he doesn’t realize that him being happy is what makes those people happy in the first place. He continues to ignore his own thoughts and feelings, afraid that the thoughts will seep back in and ruin his life. In the coming moments we see that he was right, but it’s a necessary sacrifice that needs to be made in order for him to fully face himself head-on. He says “I want to stay in this group forever”, for me it carries multiple meanings, it first reinforced his naive mindset, and second for myself it’s a reminder of the consequences of graduation. No matter how special the bonds you’ve made so far, when everyone goes their separate paths you’re bound to lose some of those friends. Maybe not gone forever, but changed. It’s a scary fact of life, and one that Shoya in his current state is unable to face. Wanting things to last forever is natural, but it’s the memories you get from those relationships not being permanent that makes them meaningful. If everything lasted forever it would all be pointless, a fact that Shoya will tragically come to learn first hand in the coming moments.</p>
<p>It all comes from Satoshi and his constant reinforcement that bullies are the worst people on Earth and that those who bullied Shoko should be punished. It’s all a little too suspicious, the scene comes out a little forced from Satoshi’s end as he relentlessly lays in this idea forcing Shoya back into his self-deprecating thoughts. Just as before, Satoshi acts as a direct voice of Shoya’s mind, breaking down his self-esteem and forcing him into his weakest position. Shoya’s thoughts are overlaid with Satoshi's comments showing the ways in which he internalizes these comments even if Satoshi isn’t meaning to directly say them to him. Shoya becomes consumed by his own thoughts, depicted through an entire page filled with black of him imagining his re-ostracization after his new friend groups finds out about his past. It’s a recurring idea with Shoya, the second his thoughts take priority of his actions or relationships, he makes mistakes, and hurts himself and others around him. Shoya isn’t able to separate his identity from his thoughts and this consistency causes him to make decisions that ruin everything he’s working to rebuild. All his self-doubt culminates in him asking Miki if she told others about his past, something that maybe doesn’t seem terrible at first, but when accounting for Miki’s personality and her constant deflecting, it’s one of the worst things he can do. It’s his worst decision yet, and one that’s consequences are felt for the remainder of the narrative.</p>
<p>“Already surrounded by this mad city, the caterpillar goes to work on the cocoon, which institutionalizes him”</p>
<p>Chapter 38: Jumping at Shadows. A perfect title for what this all represents. It’s a form of self-sabotage, Shoya knows the answer before he even asks Miki. He doesn’t genuinely want to know if she told people about him, but rather his brain uses it as a way to protect itself. Shoya’s internalized trauma isn’t gone yet no matter how much he tries to ignore it. And this is its resurfacing. The conversation devolves very quickly and results in Miki outing Shoya as Shoko’s bully to the entire class. There’s a lot more to look at in the way in which she does it though. First, she brings back the idea that learning sign language doesn’t redeem him of his past. An idea brought up by Yuzuru at the very beginning of the story, and one that is phased out as Yuzuru is able to see the meaningful effort Shoya has made to improve himself internally. Miki isn’t as complex or understanding as Yuzuru, so she tries to utilize it to offend him, to tear away at his identity, and to make him again feel like a monster in order to make sure she isn’t at all blamed for his past. It reveals how little she has changed over the years, still echoing the same ideas as when she was first introduced. Unable to accept responsibility, and unable to recognize the path to change and the ways in which it may not be as visible to one not going directly through it. Oftentimes the external results of change are felt more than the internal. Shoya’s effort to learn sign language, while not a direct step to righting his wrongs, shows that his mind is in the right place. It sets up an opportunity for him to make meaningful internal change, where it might have been harder before with a lower self-esteem. But by taking external actions to right oneself it grants the brain a little courage to make steps in the right direction and actually create change. It’s this very idea that Miki ignores, another contributor to her developing into the most irredeemable character in the story (besides maybe Takeuchi).</p>
<p>Her onslaught only continues when she directly calls out her idea that Shoya believes he’s changed, but that he’s still the same on the inside. As readers, we know it to be false, but Shoya fails to stay composed in the moment. Rather than calmly addressing the situation and trying to diffuse the heightened emotions, Shoya fires back at Miki. Something that, let's be honest, she really deserves, but it’s done at the wrong time in the wrong place. By attacking her, he exposes his own weakness. His failure to look internally is blocked out by a hateful comeback towards Miki. Nothing he says is false, but when the pressure is placed upon him, the right thing to do is to address it. Miki tells him “Don’t fabricate memories! Face the truth!” it’s deeply ironic and honestly made me laugh on re-read. A ridiculous comment considering the mouth it’s coming from, but that doesn’t nullify the effect that it has on Shoya. His spirit is broken and he starts to doubt his own memory. A dangerous thing to do. If he can’t trust his own thoughts, then there is no way for him to escape his turmoil. Shoya needs to face everything head-on, to forget about all his doubts and self-imposed judgments. To address the situation plainly for what it is and find his own path to move forward untainted by others' opinions and free from his mind’s self-hatred. But that’s not what we see here, sadly Shoya falls back on all his bad habits. His self-hating thoughts seeped back in and he is re-isolated in his mind.</p>
<p>When running away, he wishes to go to “Someplace where there isn't a single soul who knows me.” It’s a thought we’ve all had before and one that got me thinking back on my favorite video of all time “The Answer is Not a Hut in the Woods.” The video covers this exact idea. The dream to disappear for a while in the middle of nowhere. To reset one’s life with no obligations, no goals, just to live. He recounts his walking of the Appalachian trail and the lessons he ultimately found within himself from the realizations it sprung upon him. He says “I think we often hide from shame when in reality if we were just honest about what's going on in our heads our friends would give a damn and try to help.” The entire video really mirrored Shoya’s emotions and journey centered around this part of the narrative. The emotional turmoil and his eventual realization of how to overcome it. Rather than running to a place where nobody knows him, all he has to do is confide in the people around him. Tell them how he really feels, and let their empathy do the rest. Shoya runs from his solution; he thinks his isolation will protect him and the people around him, but it does the exact opposite. Shoya rejects the support system that has been built around him. He tries to convince himself he’s unworthy when in reality, just as said in the video “remember how you fixed yourself after a blue patch and realizing it was largely thanks to someone standing benevolently in the background of your life and doing it quietly from afar without you even realizing it.” Everyone has been supporting Shoya in order to try and get him to overcome his past. Whether he realizes it or not they have all exhibited so much love and support for him. Some of it not in the best ways and others misguided, but all with the intention of raising Shoya’s spirits and getting himself to walk on his own feet again. Shoya remains in the naive state expressed by the video’s creator Exurba: this self-contained egotistical idea that you and you solely are the cause of everything in your life. Shoya’s life is made full by those around him. But when faced with difficulty, he finds it easier to run away back to where he’s spent most of his life: in isolation. The answer was never to be alone, but rather to share that loneliness with others and confide in each other’s grievances in order to fill the holes created by the absence of connection. This was all a natural step in Shoya’s journey. It's never all steps forward, but it’s the steps after this that matter. To get back on track and to find oneself through community in the same ways that Exurba and Kendrick Lamar do in their respective works. Shoya’s journey is one of struggle, love, rediscovery, failure and empathy. He’s by no means perfect and this won’t be the last time in his life that he falters. Recovery is not the end of the journey, because that state of peace one desires so much truly never comes. It’s the smaller moments in between that bring us happiness. A late night with a friend, the perfect drink at the end of a long day, and the quietness of home when the world seems to stop for a while. Never believe that you're alone in your journey. While the endless freedom we all seek may be just out of reach, enjoying the moments between on the long road is what makes it all worth it. This could have been the end for Shoya, but it’s not. I had the same epiphany rewatching this video for this exact scene that I did with <em>To Pimp a Butterfly</em>. He expressed it all in a way that I couldn’t possibly do better, so I leave you with what he had to say “I'd even gently suggest that perhaps the strangest adventure, perhaps the most humbling one happens on the inside. Discovering those parts of yourself you've never acknowledged, jettisoning those parts you've never liked, and constantly, constantly being aware that you will soon turn into someone else and whoever that is is decided at every moment by you now, and in two minutes, and two minutes after that, until 10 years later one very long succession of two minutes, you find a new you sitting there and you're not even sure where they began nor where they'll end. Which makes us custodians of a sort looking after this body until a new hopefully better us inhabits it.” It’s a beautiful video and I implore you to go watch it, all credits to him.</p>
<p>After Shoya runs away, he runs into Noaka. Someone who I thought would probably be the worst possible person to run into in this situation, but I was wrong. The behavior exhibited by Noaka in this scene proved to me that her intentions are righteous even though it often hurts Shoya. The first important aspect of this scene is that Noaka appears with a cat. A reappearing image with her. From the cat cafe she works at, to this appearance. It had to mean something, nothing in this story is really coincidental and I struggled to find why the cat was important to her character. But to me, what it represents is Noaka’s similarities to a cat’s personality. Cats are often depicted as selfish and independent. Closed off from everyone else and project this confidence and superiority towards the things around them. But in reality, a lot of that boastful attitude is just bravado. At their heart, cats are loving and caring creatures. With the right opportunities, they will open up, but oftentimes, only to those that they care about. It’s an almost exact description of Noaka. She seems to be cold and mean, but when alone with Shoya, she’s often playful and cunning. Kind at heart, but expressed in the worst ways. She doesn’t consider the consequences of her actions and really only cares about Shoya. The pain she causes Shoko as a result means nothing to her. Her character is a direct reflection of that selfish attitude exhibited by cats. The cat hugs her back because they understand one another. Similar demeanors, but ones that often hurt their relationships with others. What also occurred to me here was the almost aligning of the stars between the three stories I’ve discussed where “The Answer is Not a Hut in the Woods” came back to me again. The quote aligned perfectly and once again expressed everything this story is about unknowingly. When talking about his initial reason for hiking the trail he says, “dogs will come to you for help when they're sick. They need you and they're not ashamed of it. Cats in my experience anyway, isolate themselves. They shut down and most distressingly, when they think they're dying, they go somewhere to die alone. I do the same, not to die, but getting stuck with a problem in the world then escaping from the world to try and solve it.” This is who Naoka is and the reason she’s stuck in the state she’s in. Noaka has tried to attack her problems alone. She rejects those around her, instead choosing to project her bravado and push others away in order to protect herself. People like Miki represent the dog. Someone with no shame in begging for help, relying on others at the drop of a hat. Neither perspective is really healthy. They both produced flawed characters. I feel that Noaka is often misunderstood. Admittedly going into this re-read I honestly hated her too. But the more I looked at it, her flaws were explained in the story. Used as examples for what healing looks like, and the ways in which it can go wrong. There’s no need for her to be a cat. Even if she is often cruel to her friends, they still care about her. She just needs to truly open up to them in order to initiate the healing process she desperately needs.</p>
<p>The rest of Noaka’s role in this scene is my favorite thing she does in the entire story. For the first time, Shoya vocalizes his self-hatred and blame. Things that were kept solely as thoughts are finally expressed to another person, and her reaction shows just how ridiculous his ideology is. She tells Shoya “Screw karma”, it’s a line that I love. It first, simplifies Shoya’s issues. When addressed by another person, their reaction is so straightforward. She simply tells him to forget the past and move on. Problems often get inflated when dealt with by oneself. They’re overdramatized, overthought, and escalated to levels the people involved never even considered in the first palace. Noaka gives Shoya a fresh perspective, one that’s hard for him to accept, but one that is true. It’s time to move on. But the line also serves as reference to an earlier moment in the series. It occurs during Yaeko’s flashback, where her husband is leaving her due to his disapproval of Shoko’s disability. His mother says “You know what they say, ‘karma.’ Shoko must have done something terrible in a previous life. Or maybe you did.” The idea is a disgusting one that deflects responsibility and fails to acknowledge the way in which humans are naturally created to help one another. It works together with this scene to show how Shoya uses “karma” as a kind of defense mechanism. Rather than working to clarify the situation and right any wrongs, he tries to run away. To go back to the palace where he spent the majority of his life: alone. Naoaka’s rejection of karma forces Shoya out of his comfort zone. She forces him to face his problems and prevents him from entering another life of isolation. It’s why I said this the best thing that she does. An action that isn’t laced with any sort of self-interest, she does it for Shoya’s case and his only, because she cares about him. A lesson Shoya has still yet to learn, but one that whether he chooses to or not will be taught to him. In one of the final panels of the chapter, Noaka is engulfed in light, symbolizing the end of the shadows for Shyoa. Noaka pulls him into the light, where there are no more shadows to jump at. Just himself and her and the possibility for a step in the right direction. Shoya recovers some sense of confidence from Noaka’s simple words and chooses to address it all one more time. And it couldn’t have gone any worse.</p>
<p>When Shoya attempts to engage in a real conversation with Miki and the others over what happened, he is almost immediately shut down by Miki. She rejects any attempt at healing or genuine dialogue over the past and the ways in which it must be addressed in the future.Noaka attempts to interject in order to force her to acknowledge any aspect of her previous actions, but she once again defects and rejects the responsibility that comes along with past wrongdoings. If you’ve read it before, you know where it all goes. It devolves into this deflecting shouting match where everyone tries to avoid blame and pin it on each other. It’s easy to look at the outcome and blame it on Miki. She walks in and immediately starts a conflict with Shoya. And while she is primarily responsible for sparking the argument, in the end it’s the combined fault of everyone involved. Nobody here has been able to really address their issues face to face. They’ve all pushed away, internalized, or refused to accept their role in their respective pasts. For me the most striking part of the initial argument is when Naoka says “Unlike you, I actually struggled! I’m confident that what I went through meant more!” It ties back to something that I said at the very beginning, that trauma is solely experienced first hand. There is no way to claim how one sense of pain relates to someone else’s. Without the necessary context and mindset possessed by the person who experienced it, there’s no way to make real claims about the meaning of pain. It hurts Noaka’s recent development, but reinforces the idea that all these characters are imperfect and struggling despite the fact that they all make their own attempts at improvement. This scene brings out the worst in everyone, every little character flaw comes rushing to the surface. Even Miyoko, someone who up to this point has been depicted as a mostly kind spirited person, someone who is primarily out to help others around her, is exposed for her flaws. She refuses to take any sides in the argument, choosing to reject it entirely and close herself off from any form of criticism. She always runs from other’s opinions. Afraid of what that might say about her. It’s what drove her away in the first palace, and here we get to see that it’s something that still plagues her character to this day.</p>
<p>“He can no longer see past his own thoughts, he's trapped”</p>
<p>The following breakdown from Shoya is less of an attack on his friends, and more of an attack on the parts of them he sees in himself. Just like he always had, he blames the entire situation on himself. Seeing as a reflection of his failure to solve the problem, rather than the combined inaction of the group as a whole. Noaka tries to snap back at him with the same logic she applied earlier. One that I applauded and actually got Shoya to remobilize on his journey to healing. But at this point, Shoya is trapped. He’s unwilling to accept any form of help. It’s reminiscent of the words that broke my heart 6 years ago, the ones that made me sick as I went back to find them just now, and the ones that forever changed my life and made this story resonate in the way it does: “but I ultimately turned down help. And you know what they say, you can’t help somebody who doesn’t want to help themselves.” Help is always available and even if you think the world hates you, there’s always one person who loves you. Even if it’s just one, maybe everyone has turned their backs on you, but there’s always one. There’s nothing harder than accepting help, it requires the courage to admit it, and the resolve to actually act upon it. Mindsets like these have taken so many lives, and in this scene, Shoya circles back to his “suicidal weakness.” He goes down the path that leads to the suicidal ideology he started the story with. When you’ve seen the patterns before, it hurts all the more when you see them again. For Shoya, this scene acts as almost a necessary step in his road to recovery. It forces him to stop running from the past. But in that same avenue, it hurts me to see what it does to him. Without the dramatic circumstances that come to follow with Shoko, I don’t think Shoya ever makes a full recovery. Or if he even lives to see the results of said recovery.</p>
<p>Shoya hurls insults at all his friends, and at himself. His own self-sabotage comes out in the form of offending projections towards everyone except the Nishimiyas. He tells Noaka “You’re not much different from Miki. Whether it be from the nose or the eyes, gunk is still gunk. Quit screeching, it’s laughable.” Noaka represents the terrible things Shoya has done. The past that hangs over his every thought. And just in the same way Noaka rejects her past, Shoya has failed to fully face that part of himself. He dehumanizes her through his comparison to gunk, trying to devalue her own suffering the way he has tried to do to his own. The entire sequence is a projection of Shoya’s own feelings, something all too common for those who self-loathe. His thoughts creep out of the mind and start to control the way he treats others. Noaka’s reaction to his hate exemplifies the part of Shoya’s personality she represents. It becomes clearer leather on, but I’ll touch on it here. She’s the only one who responds with silence. She’s a little shaken by what he says, but makes no attempt to defend herself or fire back. It reflects the trends she follows with her other trauma: an internalization. Noaka struggles to detach herself from the circumstances. Instead of Seeing this as an anxious outburst from Shoya, she takes it as a real evaluation of her character. In the same ways that Shoya often does the same. Her, and by association Shoya’s self hatred is expressed in her final line of the chapter where she says “honestly… I’m sick of myself.” It works as another play on the gunk idea and one that shows how hurt she really is. It’s impossible to live with the brain that hates itself. This is the self-sabotaging attitude that overcomes Shoya in this moment. Sick of himself and what he feels that he does to everyone around him. Marked as unworthy, the kind of idea that sticks around for the rest of a life. That curse in the back of the mind that traps the individual in one place of unhappy comfort rather than letting them free to explore and find the happiness that they truly deserve.</p>
<p>Miyoko tries to help Shoya clear his mind, but he tells her “Stop pretending you care, Miyoko. We all know how quick you are to run. That’s why you get bullied.” Miyoko represents the part of Shoya that’s afraid of what lies ahead. The part that doesn’t want to feel the pain that comes with change; that inner human instinct to stay comfortable and avoid any form of conflict. His comments are another projection, but one that rings home for the receiver. Shoya always feels that he is running away from his issues. His entire arc thus far, has been plagued by the thought in the back of his mind, that this is all just a distraction from his sins. Shoya feels that he himself has run away from his past, and in a way he isn’t wrong. This scene finally forces him to face himself. He feels that the bullying he received was deserved. He tells it to Miyoko, but deep down he knows it’s all just his own fears. Miyoko is shocked by his slight, responding with an insecure “No, I …” It’s the thing she always falls back on sadly, rejection. Miyoko, while definitely not the worst of the group, harbors her own guilt over the past. While her actions were initially noble, she was so quick to give up that it still looms over her sense of self. This moment, just like for Shoya, forces Miyoko to look inwards. To finally acknowledge her guilt and address what it means for her future. This shouldn’t by any means be the end for any of the parties involved. All it does is put a hard reset on their development and put a true test of will before them, showing who really has the capacity to change.</p>
<p>Miki chimes in and he says, “Miki. You disgust me from the very bottom of my heart. Please stop talking.” First thing, a little break from the seriousness, this is hilarious. I actually burst out laughing on re-read. It’s just catharsis knowing everything she’s done and said, and where it all ends up too. But then again, just like the others, it is a projection of his own feelings. Miki, the least redeemable of the group, represents the part of Shoya that will never change. That part deep in the soul that refuses to move on. He hates it with every part of him, but no matter what he does, it will always be there. It’s something he has to learn to live with, even if that self-hate will always be there, he has to learn to drown it out and prioritize his love for himself over everything else. Miki runs from the situation in the way she always does. What else has Miki done throughout the series but front her problems on other people. Leaving the bridge to let the others solve the problem she’s too afraid to face.</p>
<p>Tomohiro tries to support Shoya,but again is rejected when Shoya says “Shut up, Tomohiro. Stop saying you’re on my side when you barely know me!” Tomohiro is the voice inside Shoya still telling him that he loves him. That voice that is so easy to ignore when the hateful ones are so loud. That part of yourself that is forgotten when you start to hate yourself. I want to first focus on Shoya’s physical reaction before getting to what Tomohiro said. He tightens his body, pulling his knees in closer. It’s a symbol of Shoya’s deepening isolation. But it’s also a rejection of Tomohiro’s help. As someone tries to help him, Shoya’s mind further closes itself off. Pulling him deeper into its “protective” walls. The whole thing is reminiscent of poking a cat while they’re asleep. They point their hands over their face and coil up even tighter. A simple sign to anyone that says “please stop” without any words. It’s the same thing from Shoya, he doesn’t want to further hurt his friends, but the more they try to help the more his pain comes out. Shoya rejects his progress, denies any claims of friendship, looking to fully reisolate himself. The projection here is really interesting. Shoya tells himself that he barely knows him. A really co[plex way of displaying his self hate. The feeling that he can’t even understand himself. It’s honestly something I’ve felt before. The thought that “If you don't even know yourself, what makes you worthy of anyone else’s care.” Shoya is afraid of facing the truth that the understanding that he’s looking for comes from those people you feel unworthy of. Identity is often found through community. It’s what To Pimp a Butterfly is all about and it’s ultimately one of the central messages of this story. The message is layered underneath this scene and it shows Shoya’s soon to be realization of that fact during his coming seclusion.</p>
<p>What this all shows about Tomohiro comes more in his post reaction than the initial comments. He simply tells Shoya that, “You’re just in a bad mood today, right?” A consistent aspect of his character and likely his biggest flaw, his forced optimism and unwillingness to face his reality. This isn’t the simple squabble that they had before. Not one between loving friends who just fight for the sake of fighting. This is real emotional trauma and a desperate cry for help. Optimism can be great and it’s often lacking in so many spaces, but sometimes reality is reality. The facts need to be faced and serious action needs to be taken. Tomohiro views Shoya through the lens of his own friend rather than Shoya as a real person with his own struggles. He’s not a bad person or done as bad things as the others, he's just naive and childish in emotional moments. When things matter they have to be taken seriously or it ends in the way that it never should. Cries out like these can’t be ignored, and in the moment where someone hurting turns their back on you, it’s there where you should offer your help more than ever before, even if they don’t want it.</p>
<p>Satoshi, left as the final member of the group besides the Nishimiyas only has one comment for Shoya, “No matter how good of a person you think you’ve become, someday, you get what’s coming to you, huh?” Satoshi represents Shoya’s self harm. The darkest part of his personality. The one that when all the others leave, it’s left to finally get what it wants. Shoya invites Satoshi to hit him. And in a real show of character, he gladly does. Shoya’s self harm isn’t anything new to the story, but to see him so openly accept it is heartbroken. This is Shoya’s return to his lowest point. That part of himself that accepts the harm, the part that thinks he’d be better off dead. Shoya feels that it’s justified. Both Satoshi and Shoya believe that this is an acceptable action. It shows how deep in the mental trauma of bullying the two both are. Satoshi, who was previously the abused, becomes the abuser. A common outcome to the cycle of abuse and trauma. When nothing is learned, the cycle only continues. His slap comes off more as a misunderstanding of his own pain than his want to inflict it upon Shoya. He’s always been the hardest character to get a read on. A lot of time it feels like he’s not lying, but inflating the truth. It likely comes from his biggest moments of development being layered in pounds of Shoya’s self doubt and inner talk, but it still leaves this weird mystique around him. His detachment comes through in his comment that he’s “Just a passerby doing my part.” Cleary distancing himself from the thought that he has any responsibility in this situation. Just because he wasn’t present during the onset of the trauma doesn’t give him any kind of right to be the all-encompassing judge. There is no part to be done, Shoya has hurt himself enough and the way he seems almost giddy at what he’s done is pretty disgusting. The comment also reflects Shoya’s inner thoughts and the way that he feels he deserves to be punished.</p>
<p>Left with nothing, Shoya has to face his past. He looks up at Shoko's face. Not one of disgust, but of an almost sympathetic horror. Having been here before, it saddens me to know what she’s thinking at this moment. She feels it’s all her fault, that the group’s failure to reflect is all a product of her existence. She’s so very wrong, but her silence only expands on her own fears to step forward as well. The chapter ends on a quiet “I’m sorry everyone.” Framed in darkness, it shows how closed off Shoya has become. Back to full isolation, only putting on a front of happiness to try and help the one he feels he hurt so much. I said before that bridge represented connection. Here, it’s the opposite. A bridge between two futures. One of a renewed life, and another attempt at living, or one that ends in suicide and pain. The right path isn’t chosen, but tragically enough, it’s that very decision that finally gets everyone to wake up and address the lifelong trauma that haunts all of their beings.</p>
<p>The Shoya we get post breakdown is just wrong. It’s so forced, to an almost comical degree. It’s paired with Shoko’s quietness, her clear distance from the events at hand. The gourd scene really hammers in the whole point of this chapter. Shoya in his overly forced happiness, a clear way of him trying to distract himself from his pain, is ecstatic at the sight of gourds. But Shoko takes no notice of them, Shoya repeatedly calls them out, but obviously, she can’t hear him. It serves to reinforce their disconnect even after all the time they’ve spent together. Even if they have gotten closer, they still don’t fully understand one another. No one is really at fault, but it comes as a product of their collective failure to be truly open. She also looks extremely distracted here. A sign of what I think is their separate reactions to his breakdown. While Shoya continuously refuses to look inward, shown through his overly joyous exterior, Shoko carries it all on the inside. Mulling over the details and guilt of what happened. Detached from her current reality, Shoko remains trapped in an entirely different, but same way that Shoya is. But even though this shared pain, neither of them are able to recognize it in the other, contributing to this increased sense of distance between them.</p>
<p>Through the remainder of the chapter, he finalizes his isolation, placing his x over every one of his friends’ faces. It shows how fragile Shoya’s facade is, because even as he exudes his false happiness. In his mind, his self-deprecating attitude still rules over his psyche. There’s one moment, where he loses her in a maze, where tries to call out to her. Realizing that it’s so useful due to her disability. The moment is a direct parallel to an earlier one where she had gone missing and he and Yuzuru attempt to find her out in the rain. What I think this scene tries to tell the reader is a change in Shoya’s motivations. In the earlier scene, Yuzuru calls out Shoya for only sticking around because of his guilt. Shoya reassures that he wants to dedicate his life to helping her and righting his wrongs. What the parallel of this scene is saying, to me, is that Shoya has now renewed his dedication to her, but now in an unhealthy way. He becomes reliant on her, soloing in his purpose for living solely on helping her. It’s not good for either of them, ironically only driving both further into isolation. The whole point of Shoya’s journey was to face his past and learn to stand on his own. But if he can only live if he has her to rely on, then is he really living at all? For Shoya, Shoko should serve as an asset towards his progress, not in the sense that he uses her, but that she helps him to realize what it means to truly care for another person. She can’t be the answer to his problem, because that then leaves Shoya incomplete, still hanging onto his trauma, trying to atone for the rest of his life. Shoko should be his goal. Someone who he can finally love once he realizes his own strength. And with that strength, help her find her own, and finally move forward together—renewed, rebuilt, and ready for a future full of life instead of regret.</p>
<p>Most everything else here are used as foreshadowing for Shoko’s suicide attempt. It’s all pretty on the nose on re-read. Shoya saves a falling Shoko only to fall himself. Then he returns with the comment “The water from the waterfall saved me.” I mean it’s almost one-to-one with what happens on the balcony. I’ll touch back on what I think the meaning of that sequence is when it comes back up because I feel that it’s more appropriate in that context. Shoko apologizes for his fall, her character shrouded in darkness. Like it said, it’s all very clear. Oima doesn’t go out of her way to hide the fact that while it may seem like Shoya’s in reality, this is Shoko’s darkest moment. She tells him “Nothing good ever comes from being around me”, it can’t get much sadder than that. The very idea that your existence is a burden to others is horrid. One that eats away at the soul, and it’ll kill you if not treated. Shoya falls again trying to get up, only increasing her guilt, as she feels that once again, she is hurting the people around her just by being here. She grabs Shoya’s wrist when pulling him up, again relaying the ideas about physical touch along with the fact that they aren’t fully connected. They still can’t grab one another's hands because they don’t truly understand each other, and can’t become true friends or any form of a relationship. The chapter is called “Pretend Date” for a reason. Neither of them are in any condition to be in a relationship. To love another, you must first learn to love yourself. A fact that both of them fail to accomplish, leading to this unstable breakdown of communication in every facet. There’s still this sense of guilt and trauma laying on top of their every action, soiling their hopes at genuine connection. Showing that if things stay this way, no resolution will ever be reached between the two.</p>
<p>Shoya’s facade continues into the next chapter, and it really blocks any real attempt at analysis for me. It’s easy to see through, but it reflects mostly the same ideas that I already covered. He’s clearly broken from his breakdown on the bridge, closing himself off from the rest of his friend group. They actively make attempts at outreach, but he makes a conscious effort to ignore them and solely direct his attention towards Shoko. He creates an unhealthy attachment to Shoko’s own mental state. Trying his hardest to make her happy, in hopes that it will somehow cure him of his past and show that he has “earned” his happiness through her. Shoya says that, “I wish summer vacation would last forever” a perfect encapsulation of his fears. Summer represents Shoya’s freedom, his time with Shoko, and a space where he feels comfortable and unchallenged by his fears in the world. A Shoya existing solely in summer can shelter himself, he isn’t forced to see others or step outside his sphere where the world only falls in line with his own viewpoints. A Shoya living permanently in summer is a Shoya that never grows, one that tumbles deeper into isolation and despair as he creates avenues to further avoid facing his true self. But reality isn’t so kind. Summer ends. Shoya will be forced to be honest with his own life, he will be forced to confront everyone again. It brings me back to really the first story I ever connected with on some deeper level: Gravity Falls. I read this line and I heard Dipper say in the back of my mind, “things change, summer ends.” Nothing in life is permanent or perfect, but it’s that fact that creates opportunities for happiness, chances to explore the vast world and to find your place in a mind that you can be happy to call home. Shoya can’t remain in this liminal transition stage forever, it’s either progress or regression and this moment in time marks possibly the most important time in his entire life thus far.</p>
<p>I love the interactions between Shoya and Yaeko, as they really contribute to the sense of growth in the story, along with their simple comedic effect. It shows how she has grown, but Shoya has regressed. While she learns to accept Shoya for who he is, Shoya tries to manipulate that self into some idealized version of himself, not the version that she learned to trust in the first place. There’s another thing that really challenged me in this chapter. Yuzuru’s photo that was submitted to the contest. It’s of a bird carcass, or rather where it used to lie. Surrounded by plants and flowers, the outline of its body remains on the ground. I knew this had to mean something, and honestly, I’m not entirely sure that I’ve reached the “correct” conclusion. For me it’s message really can’t be understood until a second time through the story. I didn’t really want to jump forward in the story at any point of this essay, but here it’s necessary for me to get the point of this across. It’s revealed later that Yuzuru uses her photos of dead things to discourage Shoko from killing herself. To show her the horror of death and make her realize that it’s never the way out. I’ll cover what that all means for Yuzuru when it comes up in the story, but here I wanted to look at what that means for this specific photo. The most noticeable aspect of the photo is obviously the lack of any body; the core principle of every one of Yuzuru’s photos. If the bodies represented Yuzuru's way of preventing Shoko’s self-harm, then the lack of that body operates as foreshadowing for the next chapter, and the failure of Yuzuru’s attempt to protect her. Yuzuru’s attempts at controlling and protecting her sister ultimately fail and Shoko is left in her darkest moment, alone. I really like the meaning behind it, but it seems weird to me that it ascites as foreshadowing, but only can really be understood in retrospect. I guess it’s a stylistic choice, but also leaves me with this feeling that my assumptions are just slightly off. Maybe it means something different for everyone, but for me it’s the last breakdown of the walls protecting Shoko, leaving her completely isolated within her own self-hatred. That hate leads her to what comes next, and the part of this story I’m most scared to write about: The fireworks festival.</p>
<p>Before we get to the climax, the end of this chapter presents a really interesting view into Shoya’s mental state at this time that I think is really important for understanding where he’s gone wrong. He reflects upon the question that Sahara asked him at the beginning of chapter, “How can you prove you’ve grown as a person?” Shoya initially rejects this question by shutting down his phone. At the end of the chapter he comes up with an answer “How am I supposed to know? But… as long as I’ve got this smile… that’s good enough for me.” This won’t be Shoya’s final answer to this question, as he returns to it once he meets Shara in person again. I’ll focus on how beautiful that answer is when we get there, but for this I wanted to dig into why this answer is so flawed. What initially seems like a wholesome response, is littered with his insecurities and fears. On a surface level, it feels like Shoya is just out for Shoko’s best interest. There to help her and give her the happiness that he feels he took away from her. But in reality, this is just another excuse. A deflection of responsibility away from reflection and towards distraction. This inbetween Shoya is one that embodies all the flaws of his friends that I pointed out before. He calls out their flaws, but fails to recognize that those same flaws exist inside himself. He uses Shoko’s happiness as a crutch for his own existence. Attaching his entire personality to her rather than find confidence in himself. I love how Shoya’s flaws are buried beneath a small, but meaningful enough layer of protection. To other characters, and a non-observant reader this scene may seem like a happy one. A moment of growth, but it represents the opposite. Shoya’s thoughts have been different in the last few chapters. More positive and forward speaking. And there’s a reason for that. It’s because he refuses to talk about himself. He only talks about Shoko, constantly avoiding his own pain until it forces its way into his face in the next chapter.</p>
<p>“When trapped inside these walls certain ideas take root, such as going home, and bringing back new concepts to this mad city”</p>
<p>Fireworks. A turning point, that for me, was totally unexpected somehow. Looking back it all seems so obvious, while she doesn’t say anything explicitly, her emotions are written all over her actions and expressions. It all starts so quietly, the way these types of situations often do, symbolized by the fireworks. The night sky is obscured, and only lit aflame in the explosion of the fireworks. The sky in a way represents Shoko’s mental state in the eyes of Shoya. He doesn’t really view her as her own person, instead seeing her as this product of his past that he relies on in order to make himself feel worthy of living. The fireworks though, illuminate Shoko’s internal issues, they represent the way that her suicide attempt forces Shoya to open his eyes. To look at the light that the fireworks spark and acknowledge the darkness that they exist within.</p>
<p>I initially really mulled over Shoya and Shoko’s interaction before she leaves for home, looking for some error on Shoya’s part that causes her to attempt to take her own life. But what I think the scene is trying to say is that there really isn’t any major cause at this moment. It’s just simply a quiet moment of the two of them looking forward to the future. It reminds Shoko of what she feels she has taken away from Shoya. His friend group and ultimately his sense of self. The tragic part of their story is that both characters believe that they have “ruined” the other's life. It’s their inability to communicate those ideas and find their common misconception that results in this situation. Sometimes all it takes to reach someone is just to honestly ask them how they’re feeling. While Shoko’s entire life has been leading to this moment, her guilt from Shoya’s breakdown on the bridge seems to serve as her main motivation. She again feels that her mere existence is hurting the people around her, and that idea drives her to try and commit suicide.</p>
<p>Shoko noticeably omits her normal “see you” parting statement even when Shoya offers it initially. It’s very intentional and meant to act her way of subtly telling Shoya that there is no “next time”. He tries to reinforce his idea of loving his change in a way by saying that “‘No matter what happens, I will protect Shoko.’ I can live for that alone.” But the second she leaves and he is by himself, he looks lost. He stands solely shaded in a crowd of people obscured by the lights of the festival. Unable to live within his own thoughts, Shoya immediately redirects his attention back to Shoko. He’s afraid to face himself for even a moment because he knows the thoughts that will come to him. The fireworks in this moment act as a way to drown out the noise of Shoya’s thoughts. In the same way that they represent Shoko’s issues, finally forcing themselves into Shoya’s mind, here they show the ways in which Shoya takes advantage of those issues. He uses them as a way for him to distract himself from his own thoughts. Shoya uses Shoko’s problems as a sort of outlet, something for him to “fix”. It artificially gives his life purpose, and it’s only until those fireworks show him what could be the end, that he decides to take action. Also I have nowhere to put this, but just wanted to say that I love how Yuzuru intentionally forgets her camera so that Shoko and Shoya could be alone together, shame it didn’t work out. Very cute.</p>
<p>If I’m going to be honest, I’m scared to write this. I want to preface it with the fact that if you or anyone you know has ever attempted or committed suicide, just know that I love you. Everything will be okay, I know that isn’t enough in the moment and it doesn’t reach those really struggling, but I just want to say if someone has somehow made it this far into my ramblings, you always have me. I’m always around to help no matter who you are. No one should ever take their own life, you always have a choice, and you are always powerful enough to overcome it. Nobody is stronger than you, believe in your abilities and the future. Your life has so many things waiting for you, even if it feels like it might be the end. Suicide will never be an option, choose life, choose to be, even if existing is painful. It’s that pain that makes you human. Emotions are always inflated in the present, prioritize yourself, and recognize that those around you do love you. Even if you feel that there’s nobody who cares about you, that's simply not true. Every person you’ve ever interacted with has some degree of care for you, and they would be devastated if you took your own life. Know that you do matter, and that people do love you. Your life is more valuable than you could possibly imagine, so don’t waste it, live it through, for its worst and best moments. Eddie Kingston once said when speaking on suicide, “You just stop thinking that anyone cares about you. And you start thinking that you’re worthless and no one would care if you died tomorrow, and that’s not true. We put that in our heads to justify our pain in our own minds. Our pain is already justified, because we’re human and we’re feeling it.” It’s people like Eddie that taught me that it’s okay to hurt. That your pain is a part of who you are, not a detriment to your character. You are greater than your pain. Confide in the people who love you. Be open and honest in your conversations. Reach out to people, call them, text them, anything. There are people who love you, accept that love and find your own strength to move forward. I can’t tell you how to live, but I can tell you that being more loving and open taught me how to live.</p>
<p>I also wanted cover my own personal reasons for why this suicide attempt really spoke to me. I’m really hesitant to include this so I’m sorry if it doesn't come out perfect. It’s something I’ve never opened up about, but thought that it was partially necessary for understanding my connection to this story. Back in 2019 I lost a hero to suicide, not anybody that I knew personally, but Desmond “Etika” Amofah. A YouTuber that I loved, someone greater than life, a positive, loving, creative, charismatic, and beloved figure. I loved his content and his personality. A model for the positivity that I wanted to bring into the world, and when he took his own life, it changed mine forever. It altered my understanding of human life and the ways in which it operated. At thirteen years old I couldn’t fathom the idea that someone would end their own life. It pushed me into the darkest period of my life, but I can say now, 6 years later, that I’m grateful to the journey that it put me on. I feel guilty in saying that, but I think that without Desmond, I probably wouldn’t be here. Not having killed myself, but not as loving, smart, or compassionate as I am today. By learning from the lessons Desmond had always taught throughout his streams, those of acceptance, love, positivity, drive, energy, and consistency, I learned to find the confidence that I looked up to in him, in myself. It created an eternal appreciation for life and the time it offers within me. Even if that often manifests in detrimental ways, it reminds me to keep the larger picture in mind. To remember that things will work out in the end, and that I just have to live to enjoy myself in order to find my purpose. I wish Desmond were still here today, but reality played out the way it did. There’s so many tragedies in his story, and I wish he would have taken the time to consider its consequences and changed his mind. But as I sit here and write about it, the only thing that I can do with it is to try and take on his legacy and utilize it to improve myself and the generations to come. I love you Desmond, and I hope, although we never met, that I can make you proud. To stand proudly as a testament to your teachings. I have a poster that hangs over the very monitor I type this on today with some of my favorite quotes of his. It reminds me every moment to remember the people that carved the path to where I sit today. To keep my head level and assure myself in the times where I need it most. Etika will always be a part of my life even if he isn’t here to see it. I’ll never forget him and what he meant and still means to my life. No one has ever done it as great as Demsmond did, and I hope in my life, with his strength, I can impact people on even a fraction of the scale he did for others. I step forward in life, not leaving him behind, but carrying his memory alongside me in hopes of crafting a greater future more aware and loving of its people. I’ll leave this part with one of my favorite quotes of his towards a viewer whose sibling attempted suicide, “Emily if you’re out there, listen to me man. Look, I don’t know how hard life is on you, I can’t judge your life, I clearly can't tell the position you’re in. But listen, there’s a lot of people around you who love you that would not be happy if you decided to take yourself away like that. You have to understand that you have a responsibility not only to yourself, but to a lot of people around you. Dog, it’s not as bad as it seems, the situation is never as bad as it seems. Don’t let the negativity catch you up. Don’t approach the situation as if there’s a huge goal you have to do over years and years. Approach every day as a new day. Don’t look forward as it being a stressful thing like ‘Oh I have to do all these things.’ Just take every day at a time, one step at a time, that’s it. ‘What am I going to do today? What am I going to do tomorrow?’ That’s it, focus on the days that come, don’t care about the future too much. If you do your best every single day, then the future will map itself out. People focus way too much on how a year will be and way less than what today will be. Make today good. Hopefully you feel better Emily, I’m praying for you. Jeremy thanks for the heads up, hopefully things are better with your sister, take care. Tell her your boy said the Joycon Boyz got her.” I hope, in some way Des, I can make you proud and prove you wrong when you said we’d forget you. Love you bud.</p>
<p>But what all that means for Koe no Katachi is the buildup of those emotions. Addressed to an extent, but still creeping slightly unfinished inside of me. This scene brought that all out of me. Tears like I’ve never cried for a piece of media before. I’ve found a lifelong dedication to suicide prevention and mental health awareness through Desmond and this story. When I saw Shoko’s suicide attempt for the first time. It just brought back all the pain of those memories. Those feelings that you should’ve done more, that it was preventable, and the eternal grief that you carry within yourself. I said at the beginning that I felt this story understood me. And here it brought in what I can say was really the defining aspect of what made me who I am today. As sad as it is, suicide prompts change within the individuals left behind. It forces them to evolve and rework their understanding of their own lives and make changes in order to prevent that possibility from happening again. I felt Shoko’s pain. It brought back memories of Desmond’s final video, words that I’m afraid to hear again. A vocalization of life’s worst moment, I can’t really get the words onto paper. It was just a rush of memory and emotion that really deepened my emotional connection to this story to a degree no other work has ever done for me. It was handled in all the right ways for me, not done for shock value or a twist, but a slow build of background emotions that leads to a sudden moment that really everyone involved should have seen coming and prevented.</p>
<p>The whole scene leading into the suicide attempt is just so great. It’s one of the quietest moments in the entire series. The pacing is slow, focusing intensely on Shoya’s thoughts and actions. They aren’t super serious or dramatic, he’s just simply trying to retrieve the camera. It draws the reader in with simplicity. The tight paneling, the in depth showcasing of Shoya’s actions, all broken by the page turn to Shoko standing on the balcony. The dark tones of the room shattered by the fireworks and realization of what’s happening. The shading is dramatic, it reinforces the realness of the moment. Amplifies its intensity, and pulls the reader and Shoya out of their sense of calm. It’s amazing in the anime as well, it brought me to tears and does so well to subvert expectations and break down any feelings of comfort a first time viewer might be having. The fact that Shoko doesn’t have her hearing aid drives in that sense of finality. She’s left everything behind, there’s nothing for her beyond this point. By leaving the hearing aid at the door, she fully commits herself to what she’s about to do. It’s almost as if she doesn’t want to hear what anyone has to say. She doesn’t want the advice or the help. She just simply wants to give up. The spread following her jump is beautiful. Shoya reaches into the light, but receives nothing on the other end. The light and dark split on his body, representing his transition into a new form. One able to truly face himself, Shoya is forced out of his darkness in the worst way possible, but it works in getting him to actually prioritize the things that matter in his life. And of course, the catch. By the wrist once again. All intentional, even in her worst moment their understanding of one another is still incomplete. They still aren’t true friends or lovers, there’s still that gap, that absence of connection, and that need for one final step to truly accept one another.</p>
<h2><strong>Part 6: A Silent Prayer</strong></h2>
<p>“The result?”</p>
<p>Chapter 43: Daredevil. Daredevil huh. A beautiful callback and the realization of all that foreshadowing at the very beginning of the story with the contrast theme of jumping off bridges. To be unafraid. To face the world and its issues head on without a care in the world. That was daredevil then. Now it's all the same, but not without a care, but with every care he can possibly give. Shoya’s time for fear is long past. It’s time to finally stop, and look around. Stop fearing oneself, the future, and the past. It’s time to face the present. And the present situation is one in dire need of assessment.<br />
Shoya says “It was like any other morning. So why? Why? Why? Why Shoko? Why did it come to this?” An all too common thought process when dealing with a suicide attempt. The simple question of “Why?” The sad thing about it is that there is no answer. The question haunts those left in the world of the living when someone takes their own life. You feel like if you had just known more it could have been prevented. All days start normal, and that same idea is used in the quietness before Shoya realizes what Shoko is doing. You can’t answer why, all you can do is carry on in their memory hoping to live a life they would be proud of, and one where the reason they said “why” will never touch another person in your life. Luckily for Shoya, he doesn’t have to face that future. He next questions the situation with various “if” questions. We always wonder, “what if I had done this”, “what if I hadn’t done that”, but none of that matters. The past is done, there’s no need for if’s, because right now, reality is real. He wonders how her life would be different if he was never in it. These kinds of ridiculous ideas always come to mind in these moments of pain. They’re forms of the coping process, the grieving cycle actively playing out in Shoya’s mind. It’s natural to feel guilty when a friend tries to commit suicide. Shoya’s thoughts, while toxic, aren't necessarily negative. They’re natural steps in finding himself, and initiate his work towards improving himself.</p>
<p>His mind starts racing through all the moments leading up to this, searching for ways to save her. His doubt inevitably finds him again, and in his own character climax, he simply thinks “If I had just faced everyone head-on like I should have…” It’s here he realizes the simplicity of his problems: honesty and courage. To be honest with himself, his flaws, mistakes, past, and have the courage to face those things with his true self. To talk to the people around him, to make an honest attempt at getting to know the world he inhabits. In the same way that Kendrick finds himself on “Momma” saying “I know how people work, I know the price of life, I'm knowin' how much it’s worth I know what I know, and I know it well not to ever forget, Until I realized I didn’t know shit, the day I came home” Shoya undergoes the same realization in this moment. Through his skewed perspective and unhealthy use of his friends, Shoya has come to believe that somehow, he knows everything. Shoya tries to trap himself into a shell of a human, completely centered on Shoko's well being and presence. But this moment is his realization that he “didn't know shit”. Shoya’s home that he returns to, rather than his actual roots in his family, is his own mind. A return to who he really is, an understanding, strong, compassionate, and loving human. He grows to finally face the world for what it is instead of hiding behind his walls or viewing it through his x’s. Realizing that the community around him was always his answer. Their love, and specifically a real, honest, open relationship with Shoko is what he needs in order to live. It’s hard to truly understand another person, but when it’s there, it’s everything that’s needed to find purpose.</p>
<p>In this moment, he gives what I think is his strongest resolve in the series, a true change in character, and his realization of what the future of his life beholds for him: “I won’t run from the bad stuff anymore. I’ll stop using Shoko as an excuse. Starting tomorrow, I’ll look everyone in the face. Starting tomorrow, I'll be listening to everyone's voices. Starting tomorrow I’ll do things right.” Shoya falling acts as his ultimate commitment to recovery. The greatest form of self sacrifice, one that luckily doesn’t kill him. His renewed sense of self almost immediately impacts his thought patterns as he notices the tiny scar on Shoko’s ear from his bullying. It operates as a manifestation of true and honest reflection. Feeling guilty in the areas he should, while being able to acknowledge the fact that it is part of the past, and that all he can do now is apologize. He thinks “I should have asked you what you thought of me” a representation of his newfound honesty. The situation is complicated enough that it requires that upfrontness. These things can’t be left in the background, they need to be addressed with the seriousness and openness that it demands. Shoya’s recognition of Shoko’s scar symbolizes that notion and his active attempts to act upon those ideals.Shoya also explicitly recognizes his love for Shoko in this moment. It’s obviously been running in the background, and they both clearly express their emotions, even if not in any direct statements or anything of the like. But Shoya seems slightly incognizant of the emotions, he deeply cares for her, but it’s only here, where I think he realizes his love for her. While his thought is hidden by the explosion of the firework, it symbolizes a revitalization of his character and a way forward. Shoya’s body meets the water and he can only think “It’s cold. It’s warm.” A juxtaposition reflecting his current life situation. It obviously also plays on the idea of the cold water and his warm blood, but it also feels like a way of saying that while the fall is a cold setback, a warm future awaits him on the other side.</p>
<p>I want to take a little break from the story to touch upon some aspects of the physical release that I really enjoy. What makes me stop here is the way that this sixth volume is structured. It’s perfectly spaced out so that Shoya only appears in the first chapter, and then in the very last two pages of the volume. The entire volume gives this quiet desperate feel as his absence is really nailed in. It’s also complimented by the cover direction. Each of the 7 volumes features Shoko and Shoya standing side by side, except for this one, where Shokos is seen standing alone. I love how hard Oima works to reinforce Shoya’s absence and the grief that it brings. I also want to look at the larger cover direction as a whole. The first volume has a child version of the both of them with almost their backs to one another. Shoya looks really closed off and uncomfortable, with his hands in his pockets and a concerned look on his face. Shoko on the other hand, has her gained smile and a tight clutch on her notebook. It communicates their distance, and subtly hints towards Shoko’s inner feelings even as early as one’s first time picking it up off a shelf. While she appears happy and open. She is still facing away from Shoya, and holding her notebook with both hands. A symbol of her fear, and attachment to her trauma.</p>
<p>On the second volume, Shoya comes close to facing forward, but still has a look of fear on his face. This time he holds the notebook, not tightly, but with a few fingers. Showing his distance from the trauma and his refusal to address it in the ways he needs to. Shoko, while grown, remains in the same position. She no longer holds her notebook, but she hasn’t really changed in any way from the beginning.</p>
<p>Volume three features both of them facing forward. Still not towards one another, but close to that goal. While there has been growth on the relationship front, Shoya looks noticeably anxious and uncomfortable. Reflecting a lot of the ideas and self-doubt that he exudes in this part of the story. He no longer looks straight ahead, but down and towards Shoko. A recognition of his social anxiety, and concerns over Shoko's opinions and thoughts about him. Shoko seems genuinely happy here. While we know that’s not all true, it still marks progress in the right direction from her, while also continuing the idea of her faking her happiness to protect everyone else. She pushes forward one of her ears, indicating a genuine attempt at connection and listening. She wants to make progress, but slyly on the side she still grips her dress in the wind, outside of Shoya’s view. It’s her anxiety and trauma still lingering in the background. Trauma that Shoya fails to notice as he’s unable to face or look at her.</p>
<p>Volume four feels like a step back. They still remain facing forward, showing no forward progress from the last volume, but their mannerism suggests a regression in connection. Shoya retains his nervous look, but now looks away from Shoko and puts a hand back in his pockets, as he begins to close himself off again. Shoko puts on what can rarely be called a smile while gripping her dress with both hands super tightly. I mean her anxiety is screaming through the page. Her arms are pulled in super tight to her body, signaling her increased reservations and fear in hurting the people around her. The tension between them is very palpable, they feel more distant than ever and more reflective of the first volume than the two previous iterations.</p>
<p>Then volume five stands as this odd, outlier, where Shoya goes from dejected and then smiling and waving towards the viewer. In similar ways to his actions in the actual volume, Shoya appears happy on the surface, but his underlying feelings imply a much greater struggle. On this cover, it’s reflected in the fact that his eyes are closed. It’s the only instance of it, and quite literally shows how he is “closed” off from the rest of the world. Shoya in thai volume refuses to face the world around him, at cost to himself and the others around him as he is unable to see their struggles. Shoko looks sort of indifferent. Her facial expression is detached, and she no longer grips onto her clothing. From her intense grasp of the last volume, to letting her hands simply lay at her sides. It represents the way that she lets go in this volume. She was trying so hard to hold, but here she decides it’s time to let go.</p>
<p>Volume six features Shoko alone. Shoya is all but missing from this rendition, so it makes sense when he's not featured on its cover. But even so, there’s a lot to look at here. For the first time, we finally see one of the characters facing the other. Even if Shoya isn’t there, Shoko faces in the direction of where he previously stood. The first attempt at genuine understanding and honest expression of their connection. Shok’s bottom half is warped through the lens of the water. It shows the ways that she is broken. Despite her arm quite literally being broken, her own body and surrounding environment is warped in Shoya’s absence. Without Shoya to hold down the structure of the cover, it begins to deform under the pressure. It all speaks to their connection together, without one, the other feels incomplete. Unable to hold the very reality that they exist within together. Shoko’s attire and hair is messy and neglected. Her priorities have entirely shifted away from herself as she adopts a similar demeanor to the one Shoya possessed: that of complete obsession with helping another person and making up for the crimes you believe you did to them.</p>
<p>Volume seven, the culmination of their journey. I’m yet to get there in my story analysis yet, but I still want to include it here. Finally, they truly face one another, not facing away, or forward, but towards each other. While they both look back towards the viewer, their bodies face towards one another. They look back, obviously for composition reasons, but also to reinforce their cognizance of their pasts. They’re ready to turn and move forward, but that doesn’t mean they’ll forget where they were. To move on and forget is to never grow at all, and by taking the time to glance back at where they came from, it shows the strength of their growth. Shoya stands proudly, this time with a genuine smile on his face and his eyes open. It’s the first time he makes a genuine effort to face the viewer, and by association, the world around him. His past, his friends, and Shoko. Renewed from his absence in the last volume Shoya stands able to face the future with the help of Shoko. She has her own growth in this cover as well. First the first time, Shoko uses her hands not to hold on or let go, but to wave. Shoko waves towards the viewer. She no longer remains consumed in her own thoughts or full of anxiety. Shoko truthfully faces the viewer and the world with the help of Shoya, and the courage to use that honesty to make real connections. To me, the volume covers represent everything Koe no Katachi is all about; the meticulous details and intricate care for these characters’ journeys and inner emotions. Even in what could have been some throwaway covers, Oima could have just put a cool design and something to grab reader attention, but she decided against that. She decided to take the time to craft a complex telling of Shoya and Shoko’s story through pure visuals. To the average reader, it may mean nothing, but to me, it says more about her care for this story than anything. No visual or line went unchecked and it’s that attention to detail that makes this series so special.</p>
<p>Back to the actual plot, the narratives that follow Shoya’s fall are probably the toughest character dissections of the entire story. They’re complex, often internal reactions to trauma. But it’s the nature of trauma and the ways that it brings out different sides of one’s personality that make them so hard to understand. I wanted to start off first with Yaeko Nishimiya. She has maybe the biggest turnaround in growth of any character. She deeply bows and apologizes to Shoya’s mother for her daughter’s suicide attempt and its subsequent effects on Shoya. It marks a complete acknowledgement of understanding of her situation and the acre that it deserves. Where she would have before reacted in anger and distress, she now addresses calmly and kindly. She has by no means been a perfect parent, but all she can do now is make a shift in judgment and actions to make the world a better place for her daughters. I love the stare of honest horror that comes out of her when Yzuru declared that the entire situation was due to her mismanagement. In this moment, she finally opens her eyes to the sacrifices Yuzuru has made in her own life to try and make Shoko's life better. Yaeko sees that it was not only her who had internalized Shoko’s pain, but Yuzuru as well. It affects the entire family, and they both tried to fix the problem by themselves, only making it worse. Shoko’s suicide attempt brough her struggles to the forefront for her mother, but this moment works as a repetition of that moment, but for Yuzuru. She is forced to see that both of her daughters have been hurting, and it’s her job as a mother to try and help them overcome their respective issues.</p>
<p>Then, we once again get another Noaka conflict. The entire arc of the story where Shoya is in his coma, Noaka works as the primary source of conflict and tension within the group. At first though, she violently lashes out at Shoko in a scene that’s just painful to read. There’s so many piled emotions, complex individual struggles and motivations at play in this moment. While Noaka repeatedly hitting Shoko can obviously be seen as wrong, the things she says might not be as ill advised. What she says is mean, cruel, hurtful, but honest. After reading the letter Shoko gave her after their incident on the ferris wheel for the first time, she tells Shoko, “If you wanna play the tragic heroine, do it after you get your shit together!” It’s blunt and harsh, but what she says is true. Shoko has sat idly her entire life dealing with her troubles internally rather than asking for help and trying to address them. And while the situation is much more complicated than that, from bullying, to parental neglect, what Noaka says is true. When someone is struggling, it’s up to that person first and foremost to get help. I talked about it already during the part where I touched upon suicide, but Shoko has a responsibility to the people around her to get help. She writes in the letter and openly acknowledges that she is and has been fighting with her mental health. The fact that she is aware of the problem, but actively tries to hide it and lead others on, is her own fault. The support system surrounding her may not have been as great as it could have been, but especially after her reintroduction to Shoya, there was a space for her to heal. But Shoko actively secluded herself from the group and made herself out to be the villain, and sadly that is her fault in a way. It’s often hard to admit that those who try and take their own life often play a fault in the outcome, but it’s true. It’s never the answer, and they know that, but they still try and do it anyway. It hurts me to say it, but when doing that, they actively know that they are hurting not only themselves, but everyone else around them. The rest of Noaka’s tirade is less truthful and more of an expression of misguided hatred from her shock of Shoya’s fall. Angry at herself and her inaction, she directs that anger towards the people around her. While it focuses on Shoko, her quickness to divert that anger to anyone who intervenes shows that it’s less of a targeted attack and more of a choice of an outlet. All that being said, her fight with Yaeko comes somewhat deservedly, but really comes from a failure in communication on both ends. While it’s always best to address issues with a healthy conversation, sometimes feelings just come out in the wrong way, and this is what their fight is really about. Noaka continuously tries to isolate herself, but having learned from Shoya and recent events Miyoko makes an active effort to stop her from doing so. It’s a noticeable mark of growth in her character, and shows an honesty and reflection that most other characters in the series fail to do.</p>
<p>What follows this scene, is my favorite panel in the entire series. It comes during the scene in which the reason for Yuzuru’s photography is finally revealed. Stemming from a single incident where Shoko states that she wanted to die, Yuzuru directs her life's purpose towards preventing that future. Using the pictures as a means to depict the horrors of death in hopes to scare Shoko away from ever taking her own life. Yuzuru realizes here that it was all futile, that if she had just faced the situation head on and had an honest and open situation, the feelings maybe could have been worked out. Of course, it’s never that simple, and questioning things in retrospect will always make it seem easier than it really was in the moment. But it just serves as another example of characters in the story failing to address their issues. By dodging around and teetering on genuine discussions, the problem is never truly addressed. It takes courage to face oneself or another person, but it's that courage that allows for true growth. After this realization, there's just this quiet release of tension where the tears from both Yuzuru and Yaeko begin to flow. The quick sequence of shots of Yuzuru and her mother, the final breakdown of their walls, where they’re pictured side by side finally letting themselves cry. Finally opening up to one another and acknowledging the feelings that have been hanging over them for so many years. It then breaks into a single tear, one that is revealed to be Shoko’s. She is pictured alone on a white background, which then opens up to show the entire Nishimiya family in tears. My favorite panel in the entire story, and the moment that spoke to me the most on my re-read. The entire page is silent. There’s no words, and there’s really no need for them. Their tears tell their story, and it’s all understood through context and buildup. The walls separating their true feelings are finally gone, and when those shared emotions are faced, it just brings a rush of both sadness and guilt from all parties involved. The work inside the panel itself is also great. Yuzuru and her mother face opposite directions on the far ends of the panel. Shoko is placed in the middle, almost unseen by her other family members. But she is able to face forward when they face away. She serves as the means of connection of the family. Through her struggle, they have found a way to candidly address each other. Everything about this scene is just great. The sorrow is palpable in the silence, and it feels that only here can these characters truly move forward. Not as individuals, but as a family. One that is open with each other and their experiences and unafraid in helping one another find the courage to live. I think funnily enough, during the time in which I wrote this, I found a quote that perfectly embodies the feelings behind this scene. It comes just at the start of the second part of Mary Shelley’s <em>Frankenstein</em> and it says, “Nothing is more painful to the human mind than, after the feelings have been worked up by a quick succession of events, the dead calmness of inaction and certainty which follows and deprives the soul both of hope and fear.” It’s the quiet moment that follows that of a tragedy that really lays in the emotions. I don’t think this moment carries the negative connotation that looms over the Frankenstein quote, but I do think the expression of ideas aligns with what the characters are experiencing here.</p>
<p>In the following scene, Yuzuru throws out her photos, and Shoko throws out her old ride-on car. Both symbols of their past and a mark of renewed resolve and mindset moving forward. But in writing this, I also realized something else. The ride-on car holds much greater symbolic significance. It first represents Shoko’s childhood, and the pain and trauma that she carries from it. The toy serves as a direct reference to that part of her life, and how it still affects her today. But where it becomes important, is in her suicide attempt. In order to step up onto the balcony, she uses the car as a stepping stool onto the ledge. It’s only after seeing her trash it that I realized what it meant. Shoko quite literally steps into a suicide attempt with the help of a symbol of her childhood trauma. It’s a direct clarification of her reasons if they weren’t already clear. By holding onto her past, she has let it rot away in her brain and allowed the guilt to internalize inside her. In a way, it’s a callback to the very beginning, and Shoko’s attachment to the notebook that Shoya brings her. Both are objects that she has no use for, but ones that she still seems attached to. Shoko’s debilitating flaw has always been her refusal to move on from the guilt she feels. She’s very similar to Shoya, but on the opposite side of the situation. But here, when she decides to leave the car in the past and throw it away, she overcomes that flaw. She enters a new era as a renewed Shoko with the strength to face the future head on, unburdened by the past. While those scars are still there, both internally and physically, they aren’t something she’s ashamed of. They no longer pull her away from the life she wants to live, they instead act as a lens through which she views her current world, in hopes to make it a little more loving and kind for the people around her. Renewed and resolved, Yuzuru asks Shoko, “Going somewhere?” to which Shoko gives no answer. She simply turns around and walks in the opposite direction of the trash. This time pictured walking together with Yuzuru into the white background. The same background that just two pages ago, she stood in front of crying. Now ready to face the white, or the unknown, with the strength and help of the people who love her.</p>
<p>Just to preface the next section of the essay and story, I’m going to try and focus in on each of the side characters as they’re given their full focus chapter. I already gave a lot of my dissection of their characters’ back at the bridge scene, but I’ll try to wrap up some ideas. I’ll likely talk about many if not all of them again during the final arc of the series, but just know that more of my in-depth analysis will probably be left here.</p>
<p>Tomohiro Nagatsuka. Tomohiro’s chapter centers around his fear, his fear to reflect, his fear to face uncertainty, and his fear of being genuine. Tomohiro is by no means a bad influence on anyone around him, but it’s his attempts at being a good influence that reveal his insecurities and flaws. His kindness as shown in this chapter, is built on top of a susceptibility to others and his insecurity about his lack of friends. Tomohiro extends a helping hand to Shoko, and in her nature, she then returns compliments back at him. But when he receives these compliments, it immediately flashes to his own memories of the times when he lied about having friends. It’s something that lays in the back of his mind unaddressed. Even though he’s found a friend in Shoya, I think there’s a large part of him that either feels undeserving, or afraid. He says that befriending Shoya is what taught him what real friends are, and he’s right, that moment marks the beginning of his journey to becoming a more complete person. But I think he avoids the necessary reflection that he must undergo in order to address the things really bothering him. The small flashes of doubt at the sight of a complement, and what feels like an almost invisible wall between him and the people around him. I’ve felt it all before, I know what is, and I see it in him. That refusal to accept any sort of push or praise from another person, it’s a socially destructive behavior. One that hurts the foundation upon which relationships are built upon. The interplay between commendation and fun is what creates connection. By eliminating the former, or feeling unworthy of any degree of it, it makes it hard to feel that a relationship is genuine. It makes everything feel one sided. None of this explicitly said, and maybe I’m projecting on him, but I’m almost sure that’s the underlying ideology that his character is based on. All that said, this chapter serves as his attempt to make improvement upon himself, and his way of turning away from his negative attributes.</p>
<p>It starts with him asking Noaka to resume work on the film. A small gesture that he knows will likely go ignored, but one that shows a renewed sense of strength within him. Tomohiro has always been afraid of Naoka ever since the first time she cruelly scolded him. She represents a direct sense of fear and apprehension for Tomohiro. But in facing her now, even if the effort is futile, he shows his courage. Unafraid of what stopped him in the past, Tomohiro makes his largest moves ever towards his ultimate goal: to be genuine. To experience genuine friendships and experiences with people that he loves. It’s a simple goal, and one shared by almost all living things on Earth, but in its own way, simplicity is what drives all human motives. His chapter then transitions into its conclusion and delivers what I believe to be one of the main messages of Koe no Katachi as a whole. He reads the notepad he was using to communicate with Shoko, where he sees the message: “I want to restore what I destroyed.” His response, “Let’s do it together!” Again a reinforcement of that simple idea. That healing occurs not alone on the inside, but with the help of your surrounding world, community, and loved ones. Life’s challenges and gifts are meant to be experienced together with others. That’s what this story is all about. Finding connection in the place you lost it. Finding strength and love through others. And most importantly, finding love for oneself with the help of people that love you for who you are. Tomohiro’s chapter ends with a final panel where he joins Yuzru and Shoko in their walk towards the white unknown. It shows that no matter how different the struggle, the end goal is always the same: to walk into the future positively, optimistically, and excited alongside the people who make you happy to be alive.</p>
<p>Miyoko Sahara. Her fear stems from others and her views on their perceptions of her. Miyoko fears that she’ll be outed and chastised the way Shoko was. In that classroom, she learned that if you aren’t part of the group, you’re hated. So for most of her school career, she tried to chase that approval. To appeal to others and their perceptions. Sahara tried to someone she wasn’t in hopes that the world would accept her. When in reality, if the world doesn’t accept you for who you are, you’re just looking in the wrong place. Everyone has their own sphere of the world that loves them just as they are. The difficulty of life is trying to find that space. To me, a pre-reformed Shara is summed up by, funnily enough, a Kendrick Lamar song, FEAR. One line really stuck out to me, it said, “I practiced runnin' from fear, guess I had some good luck. At 27 years old, my biggest fear was bein' judged.” That’s simply who Shara was, she was afraid of being judged, whether that judgement be good or bad, Sahara ran from the very idea of perception. To be afraid of fear is to never experience anything. Miyoko let her fear control her for so long, and it still manifests in the way she lives today.</p>
<p>The beginning of her chapter is laced with traces of her fear. She asks herself, “Why didn’t she come to me with her problems?”to which she thinks, “But I won’t ask her any of that. There’s nothing that could’ve been done about it, probably.” That trailing probably says everything about her that needs to be known. Sahara knows that she’s wrong in avoiding a direct confrontation with Shoko and her suicide attempt. While able to recognize the flaws in her thinking, she still fails to act upon it. That’s where her fear controls her. Instead of rising above that fear, she lets it make decisions for her. On the very next page, she chooses to wear her traditional shoes instead of her heels. Another example of her fear of perception. She’s holding onto the criticisms that Naoka threw at her and her fashion sense earlier in the volume. Instead of expressing herself purely, she appeals to what she believes to be the wants of the world around her in order to avoid their criticisms. She remains hung up on the idea of proving that she’s changed. To show the world that she’s evolving as a person, and making that effort to be better. She continuously repeats the idea “Improve yourself. Keep changing.” a valid idea, but one that acts as a poison to the mind when that change is for others and not oneself. She remains set on that very idea of change until this chapter. But even in it, she’s seen chasing the achievements of Noaka. Trying to expel those feelings of inadequacy by pouring her entire being into her work. But what she doesn’t realize is that her being isn’t truly being expressed when it’s all in an effort to gain the recognition of people who aren’t yourself. Art is inevitably made for its creator. No matter how much the consumer would like to say it’s made for and should be catered to them, art is solely an expression of its creator. And when that art comes from any other place except for the heart, it’s visible and saddening. What Miyoko learns in this chapter though, when on the verge of giving up on her dreams after being rejected by Noaka, is from a simple gesture from Shoko. She simply realizes, through her interaction with Shoko, that the change she’s looking for isn’t in her art, but in herself. While yes, that change is expressed through the things she makes and does, and her confidence in them, it all starts from a smaller journey on the inside. It’s all reminiscent of the ideas expressed earlier in “The Answer is not a Hut in the Woods.” That humanity’s greatest journey is the quiet one that we undergo within ourselves. Miyoko realizes that gaining the approval of others isn’t what she wants, she just wants to prove to herself that she’s made an effort to change. That’s often extremely difficult as we tend to over criticize and shame ourselves, but realizing that fact is the first step in making the long and never ending process of learning to love oneself. Miyoko ends with a simple idea, the same one she’s repeated the entire chapter, but this time in its complete form, “Improve yourself. Keep changing. And never stop.” It shows her recognition that the change she’s looking for won’t be something she can achieve and feel the effects of immediately, but it’s a process that she’ll undergo for the rest of her life. That chasing that improvement is what gets out of bed every morning, and that the approval she seeks doesn’t come from her peers or rivals, but the most important person in her life, herself. I want to make sure that anyone, no matter who you are, if you’ve experienced any of the emotions expressed by any character in this story, is completely valid. Everyone has a different perspective on this story and relates to different characters, but for those of you who’ve felt even a shred of the feelings Miyoko has, I leave you this quote from one of my favorite professional wrestlers, John Moxley: “ Hell, nobody's perfect, alright? If everybody was perfect the world would be a very boring place, so NOBODY, nobody - no matter who you are - should be afraid to stand up in front of the whole world and bare it all. Everything that makes you the person that you are, scars and all, and say "HEY, THIS IS ME!" Be who you are, and be proud of all of it, flaws, inconsistencies, mistakes and all, we still love you.</p>
<p>Miki Kawai. Man, I hate her. What a deplorable human being. While I introduced the last two characters with what drives their fear, here I want to preface that Miki’s fear is unjustified and pathetic. Miki is afraid of any form, no matter how small or large, of criticism. She’s already showcased this trait, specifically in her outburst on Shoya when he asks her if she had told anyone about his past. She deflects any and all negativity, even when that negativity is valid and should be acknowledged. The hard part is that she often does things or intends for things that could be considered admirable. For example, in this chapter, she proposes the idea to fold a thousand paper cranes for Shoya once he gets out of the hospital. Something that I think would genuinely go a long way, and is a good show of the class’s care for him. But where she goes wrong in these situations, is that she always makes it about herself. Here, she does the same. She takes some of her classmates' annoyance at having to fold the cranes, and turns it into them somehow actively bullying her. Where the last two chapters focus on their respective characters' attempts to cope with their struggles handling the perceptions of others, Miki doesn’t make any effort to actually make an inward change. Instead she blames the people around her, saying, “Why do I have to be treated like this?” First off, she’s clearly not being bullied. While yes, the things her classmates were texting were unkind, they weren’t directed at her and were not nearly scathing enough to warrant the inner monologue she goes on. A monologue in which she utilizes to somehow transfer the blame of her arrogance onto Naoka. It’s her way of avoiding the guilt that she knows she feels. If she can transfer it onto someone else, it makes her feel better about herself, and allows her to further bolster her obnoxious ego. She then tells Satoshi that she’s being bullied, to which he completely accepts without question. These two characters being as close as they are represents the way that they support each others’ shallowness. Neither of them are capable of any form of honest self reflection, and the product is this unhealthy interdependence on one another where they justify each other’s ideas without consideration for anyone else involved.</p>
<p>Miki’s interaction with Shoko once they reach the hospital is just vile. She starts off by slapping Shoko in the face, like are we serious? Excuse the gendered language, but Miki is the biggest bitch I’ve ever seen. She goes on to give a speech about the value of life, the present, and embracing one’s flaws—something that I totally agree with and have covered extensively thus far. But what sickens me about this is that, the entire time, she’s hugging Shoko and directing her speech at her, when in reality, she’s just talking through her and directing it all back at herself. I’m going to hold off on being preachy here and analyzing what she says, because it all feels so fake and incorrect to make a genuine attempt at analyzing. But what bothered me about her character on this reread, was a constant question that I felt through her entire presence in the story: “Why is she here?” What purpose does she serve if she just remains flat, stagnant, and an overall irredeemable character through the entire story? But the conclusion I reached on the topic was simple: she’s an embodiment of the people, that no matter how much you show them, or ask for their help, will never change. I hate saying it, but some people just refuse to change. Whether that’s because of their upbringing, surrounding themselves with the wrong people, some internalized narrative, or just simple fear of accountability. There will be people out there, that just won’t help. They might not be bad people, they just aren’t the right ones for that space. And that’s what Oima tries to use Miki to teach the readers. In your own struggles, you’ll encounter people just like Miki. The self-interested and absorbed person who tries to use your suffering to their own advantage as some way of garnering sympathy. Those people are out there, and always will be, what’s important is that we recognize their existence, and rather than hanging our heads over it, choose to ignore them and confide in the people that do truly care for us. Sadly not everyone will be out for your best interests, but in her story, we can realize that they’re just flawed people trying to their best as well. Maybe their best isn’t the reality that we’d like to accept, but it’s a very real one that requires thought and care in its own right. I would hope that if you’ve made it this far, you’re not a Miki yourself. Be like Sahara, Tomohiro, Yuzuru, Shoya, and Shoko. Be unafraid of reflection, of conversation, and of change. It’s all difficult, but it’s the most important step in making genuine change.</p>
<p>Wanted to include a quick aside for Miyako as she has a small moment in Satoshi’s chapter where she comes to visit her son and has her first ever interaction with Shoko. I love the slow moment of realization that they both have as they realize who the other person is. Shoko acts in almost panic in order to write down what can only be assumed is a heartfelt apology, but before she can finish, Miyako just walks away. She says, “I don’t know what to say to her. I can comfort her or yell at her. I can even talk to her with a smile, but none of that feels real. So let’s talk after Shoya wakes up.” This quote was perfect. It encapsulates all the insecurities that come with helping people, facing people you feel you’ve hurt, and the compounding guilt that comes from one’s mistakes. I can say from personal experience, and anecdotes from friends, that this struggle is universal. Facing and trying to help people who you know are hurting. Everything that’s said feels artificial, like some kind of obligatory comment of support. Shoya’s mother, like many of us, doesn’t know what words could possibly be said. What could she say to Shoko that could summarize the well of emotions that have come from the past few months? Really nothing. Should she be angry? Probably not, it often just worsens the situation. It’s an almost impossible situation to face, and that’s why she walks away. I can understand where her mind is at. When evaluating the options, it really seems like there’s no best approach. Sometimes that’s the case, and that’s what this scene shows its readers. That there isn’t always an immediate answer to an issue or confrontation. Sometimes the best thing that can be done is simply to walk away. To leave it for when both parties are better equipped to handle it and its consequences. Conflict can’t always be immediately resolved, and that’s okay. Time and space away can do so much to help people work through their issues. Miyako’s recognition of that fact shows her immense strength in this moment.</p>
<p>I also wanted to call out the recurring symbol of her earring that is used here. The earring on her right ear is highlighted in the three panels where she says the quote that I covered earlier. This emphasis on her earring is a callback to the first interaction between the two protagonists' mothers'. After their first meeting, Miyako’s right ear is bleeding, whether it was her own doing, or Yaeko’s, I’m unsure. I want to lean towards the idea that Miyako would rip her own earring out in apology, but I don’t believe it’s ever confirmed. The recurring image of her earring in the present scene serves as a reference to that moment. It symbolizes the shared pain that all members of the situation hold. Her earring acts a representation of her sacrifice and guilt towards her son’s actions. But in this moment, that guilt is reversed. Shoko now feels she is the one that owes Miyako, but that apology is again postponed. The situation remains unresolved, and her earring and guilt still hangs over her. Maybe it’s a symbol of avoidance, of fear of that apology, or maybe it’s a recognition of that fact that the guilt may never go away. Its heaviest burden has been passed to Shoko, but it still lives on in all other people involved. It showcases the complex nature of guilt, and the difficulty that comes from trying to overcome it.</p>
<p>Satoshi Mashiba. The one who I can pretty comfortably say is the hardest to analyze. His entire character and motives are very ambiguous. There’s no proof of anything that he says, and he often contradicts or shelters his feelings and thoughts. This point is most apparent in the alleged bullying that he went through as a child. While it does seem like he was made fun of for his eyebrows, it doesn’t seem like the kind of mistreatment that would be classified as bullying. But what I think this is meant to be is someone labeling themselves as a victim, even when there are others who are going through worse. What Satoshi experienced was wrong, but if the extent of that bullying is what we see in his flashback (two children lightly poking fun at him), then he really has no right to compare and equate his struggles to Shoko. There’s nothing wrong in standing up for something you believe in, even if you may not have fully experienced that struggle, but when you start evaluating your own and others' pain through comparison, you’ve taken a step in the wrong direction. I think Satoshi latches onto his bullying, because without it, he’s unsure of who he is or what his life means. Satoshi runs from these feelings by latching himself onto his perception of himself as a victim of bullying. He uses it to justify his actions, from hitting Shoya to his own evaluation of himself. But here, in this chapter, Satoshi reflects on those feelings and finds his way to move forward leaving that artificial victimhood and purposelessness in the past.</p>
<p>Just like most everyone else in the story, Shoya’s fall spurs an intense internal change within Satoshi. The actual bulk of his character arc in his chapter begins with his story to Miki. He tells her a story about his class, and what their bullying to him did to the class. The story he tells is almost identical to what actually happened in Shoya and Shoko’s class. He puts emphasis on the people who the people who were bullies, but then avoided taking responsibility. Miki reacts in disgust, calling all of them scum. Satoshi then breaks the story by saying that it was all made up and that he was just thinking of how self-centered everyone is. It’s a pretty on the nose shot that goes right over her head. It makes me think that Satoshi silently dislikes Miki. He pretty much reverses her own comment about them being scum back on her, his way of insulting her without her actually knowing. What that whole story says about him is difficult to place a maker on. To me, it suggests a much higher emotional intelligence then he lets on. He seems like he tends to conform and follow Miki and her impulses, but here, it seems like a point of change for him. He seems to open his eyes to Miki’s selfishness, and even to his own. Satoshi reflects on his past in this also most psychotic nature and ithrough that reflection realizes his misstep in purpose. Satoshi has attached his life’s purpose to a toxic external goal, rather than something that actually drove him internally. What I thought was his biggest character reveal comes after his mom asks him if he really wants to become a teacher, to which he thinks, “Of course I do. That’s the only way I can get over this murky feeling.” To me, this showed Satoshi’s failure in character up until this point. Just like almost every character in the story, Satoshi has avoided the inner reflection necessary in order to form his true character. He’s latched his purpose onto a vague goal he came up with to avoid the uncertainty and insecurity that comes with genuineness. By the nature that Satoshi is written in, we don’t get any true answers on who he is or where he ends up. But what is revealed is his initial intentions during his introduction to the story. His interest in Shoya is derived from his desire to be “normal”. But in that quest to prove that Shoya was “weird” and he himself “normal”, he found the exact opposite. He never says what that opposite is, but to me, it’s the realization that there is no such thing as normal. It’s an idea that was introduced to me in that same interview with Eddie Kingston that I mentioned earlier. He says, “There’s nothing wrong with us if we have those kinds of feelings. There’s nothing wrong by the way. There’s no such thing as normal. Let me put that out there. There’s no such thing as normal. We make our own normal.” Normal is an idea that is created in the mind of its conceiver. What’s normal to one person may be strange to another. When Satoshi says that he wants to be “normal”, it shows his lack of emotional depth. His active chasing of the idea of the normal, creates this void of self-acceptance. By striving to prove oneself as normal, it voids the creative space and uniqueness that makes one human in the first place. Running away from the uncomfortability that often comes with being different means leaving behind all the connections that come from it. That uncertainty of being one’s purest self is scary, but it’s the exact thing that breeds the deepest connections that can be found in life. Through Shoya’s open expression of himself in that moment on the balcony, Satoshi, even if he wasn’t there, realizes his truth. He goes back to Mr. Takeuchi, and now, instead of rejecting him, he makes an honest appeal to him. Even if he knows what Takeuchi did was wrong, he puts his honest self forward. Not hiding behind his bullying lens, or in an effort to maintain his self esteem. Satoshi gives the situation the respect it deserves in order to try and secure a better future alongside the people who love him. He’s rejected again and made fun of, but in the final panel of his chapter, he just simply smiles in the face of that criticism. He realizes that it’s no longer a representation of his character, but rather that of Mr. Takeuchi’s. Satoshi’s self can’t be touched by the comments of others, because he’s reformed it upon his own mental reflection and commitment. With a newfound identity, confidence, and comfort in his skin, Satoshi moves forward in his life unafraid of what the world perceives him to be, or what they believe his life to be for. Satoshi, even if he doesn’t know it now, will find his own path, his own people, and his own purpose. Not attached to some external goal or person, but rather one connected to his inner journey that helps him to realize his own value.</p>
<p>Noaka Ueno. I wanted to first start out by highlighting another moment in Satoshi’s chapter before I get to her own. When Miki confronts her about being selfish by blocking the room due to her love for Shoya, she says, “You don’t have any right to act so high and mighty in the first place!” to which Noaka flusteredly responds, “Yes, I do! More than anyone!” This scene is almost exactly parallel to two previous scenes that I’ve touched upon. The ones where Shoya is told that something has “nothing to do with him”. Here, that comment is flipped on Noaka, and just like Shoya responded to her the first time, responds in panic and insecurity. What makes this scene so insightful into how the story tells its larger narrative arcs on progress is in the differing way that Shoya responds to the question. When asked the question again by Yuzuru, Shoya is able to remain composed and address the situation wholeheartedly rather than acting out of impulse. That moment is placed in the middle of the story, and this moment 20 chapters later, serves as a way to show the lack of improvement and development in Noaka. Where Shoya was able to grow and learn from his first mistake, Noaka remained stuck in her ways. It’s what her character is all about, and probably my favorite way that it’s addressed in the entire story. It’s layered, and maybe goes over the head of the average reader, but to those looking for its patterns, the story offers so many little details that give insight into smaller character narratives, and the ways those intertwine with the parallel journeys of their friends’. Those small moments and complexities are what has brought me to love this series so much more over the course of writing this essay. And the thing that has made me come around on understanding characters like Noaka who might initially seem irredeemable.</p>
<p>The first half of Noaka’s chapter is spent reflecting on her love for Shoya and where and how it developed. She reflects on the way that the class turned on him, and she idly sat by watching it all happen. She even joined in on the bullying, afraid of making a change or isolating herself in the way she saw was being done to Shoya. An important moment in this flashback comes from her memory of her first time writing something hateful on Shoya’s desk. She says that she's “already forgotten” and it’s scribbled out in her memory. This was a major red flag to me, and an in your face way of showing that Naoka is going through her own metal struggle as well. Repressed memories are a signifier of trauma, ongoing psychological issues, and a defense mechanism against those issues. Naoka avoids those memories because they make her feel the guilt that she knows she should feel. She runs from that guilt. She pushes it away in order to maintain her self-esteem. Naoka doesn’t know who she is if she’s not behind her braggadocious obnoxious mean girl front. By hiding behind that persona, it allows her to convince herself that she’s not a good person, that she’s irredeemable, but deep down, she knows it’s not true.</p>
<p>Naoka paints Shoko as this manipulative faker who utilizes the emotions of others in order to garner sympathy and power over Shoya. It’s very obviously something that Noaka doesn’t truly believe, but something that she implants in he remind in order to avoid the simple truth: that Shoko and Shoya just genuinely care about one another. They’re just nice people striving for the best for one another. Naoka, like everyone else, can see very clearly where their relationship is headed. That future, spent together, is one that doesn’t include Naoka. Not out of malice or contempt, but simply because Naoka and Shoya aren’t perfect for each other. That’s a reality that Noaka refuses to face, and the reason that she constantly blocks out the ideas and feelings of others. Naoka works tirelessly to maintain her facade and perceived influence over Shoya. She thinks that if she can control him and the way he thinks, then she can keep him in her life. Naoka is just afraid of becoming her own person. In a similar, but different way, her struggle is almost the same as Satoshi’s. He attached his purpose to an artificial goal, and Naoka attaches hers to an artificial reality and relationship that she knows will never happen. She’s one of the most self-aware characters in the entire series, she just refuses to acknowledge those feelings because of how they make her feel. Naoka resists change with her entire soul. Naoka desperately wants things to return to how they were when they were children, but that’s simply not reality. Their world has changed so much since then, and Noaka along with it. She just doesn’t let that change rise to the surface, and instead buries it under her layers of repression in the same ways she does that trauma for her childhood.</p>
<p>Naoka realizes the finality of this moment, when she says, “If he’s not going to choose me, then I’d much rather he never wake up.” I don’t believe it’s in any way a serious statement, but rather a recognition of the fact that she knows this is the end. She knows that once Shoya wakes up, he’s going to reach out to Shoko, and that their genuine relationship will be able to spark. It’s a fact that when staring her in the face, will force her to move on. She knows that this coma is her last chance to remain frozen in the past, and to run from the truth, so that’s what she does. She sits around and ruminates about her history with Shoya, and the fact that he doesn’t reciprocate her feelings. There’s nothing she can do to change that fact, but it wouldn’t be Naoka if she wasn’t trying to control the emotions of others, would it? Naoka knows that she’s lost control of the situation, and it results in a desperate attempt for her to maintain the world that she wishes still existed. Naoka has lost a lot of her spirit in this moment, she knows what the future holds, but she’s afraid to face it.</p>
<p>Her chapter ends with an interaction with Shoko. Their moments are often so heated and emotional. This one presents on the calmer side. Naoka’s bossiness and anger is still there, but Shoko remains silent, beyond the use of her notebook. The rain compliments the quieted tone, and really isolates the moment between them. It reinforces the distance between the two of them. Acting as a metaphorical and physical wall between them and their understanding of one another. They’re two people that know the other’s struggle, but one end of the conversation just refuses to accept that. Noaka continuously rejects Shoko’s attempts to get her resume her work on the movie. Even further hammering home her steadfastness and unwillingness to change. Their argument is broken by a line from Naoka that seems to stun Shoko. She writes in her notebook “Save the jokes till after you give Ishida back to me!!” It's a line reminiscent of an earlier one from Shoko in Tomohiro’s chapter, “I want to restore what I destroyed.” There’s a pause in the paneling that focuses solely on Shoko’s eyes, the pain clearly visible on her face. She still feels that she’s hurting everyone around her, and even when she makes the effort to mitigate that hurt, she’s rejected. Naoka presents as Shoko’s biggest challenge. The one person who won’t even act like she wants to change. The moment serves as a reminder to Shoko that healing isn’t a simple process. It can’t be forced or sped through. Some people will take longer, and some people won’t change at all. That hurts Shoko, and it only enhances her guilt, but where she would have faltered before, she now stands and moves forward.</p>
<p>Throughout the entire scene, Shoko repeatedly tries to hold an umbrella over Noaka’s head, but again and again, Noaka pushes her away. Until she doesn’t. She doesn’t accept it, or acknowledge it, but Shoko quietly follows behind her, and Naoka doesn’t resist. We don’t get to see the extent of that walk, but I would presume that it’s silent. There’s nothing written down or communicated, because it’s all communicated through Shoko’s kindness and Naoaka’s acceptance of it. The umbrella stops the rain from falling on Naoka, but opens it up to Shoko. It represents her consistent sacrifice for the people around her, even if those people don’t reciprocate it. But the removal of that rain above Naoka also represents her allowing the wall between herself and Shoko to fall. She finally accepts the world as it is, and Shoko, her struggle, her relationship with Shoya, and their past for what it is. Not vocally or in any written moment, but it’s clear from a reader perspective that she’s trying to move forward. She offers Kazuki’s email to Shoko in order to help with the music production on the film. It’s her way of helping out. She may not have the capacity or emotional space to actively participate, but she does what she can. And that’s what matters. Not everyone can give their all for every issue, sometimes you just put forward what you have. That may not always be enough for everything, but it’s all you can muster at that point in time, and that’s okay. It marks a big concession for Naoka, and a really big step forward even if it doesn’t feel like one. This is her declaration that she’s moving on. Naoka is leaving behind her past. By opening Hazuki up to the group not through her, she gives up control. The thing she was previously so attached to. She lets the situation play out the way it was meant to, outside of her control. Naoka gives up on dictating the future in the lens of the past, and lets everything play out naturally between the people that make that future valuable. It really hurts her, but progress often does. She restates a quote from earlier in the chapter and says, “In the end. All I can do is watch.” Where before, she watched Shoya get bullied and let him fall into his depressive spiral, here she watches as those very same people work to earn back his trust. Sometimes watching is okay, not every situation can be manipulated to result in the outcome you desire. Everyone has their own motivations and goals, and when it’s for the better of the people you love, watching idly can be the right answer. Naoka knows that what she’s doing isn’t actually in the best interest of Shoya. Here she, even if not actively herself, lets what’s best play out. Even if she doesn’t have the strength to actively participate, by allowing it to happen she shows a tremendous step in growth and a mark of her true character. Naoka is a good person. She knows that deep down, and this acts as her first step in realizing that truth. There’s still one more Naoka moment left in the story, so I’ll save my final thoughts for then, but I just wanted to point out that she has slowly become one of my favorite characters in the series while writing this. She’s so complex and fun to break down, and most importantly, she’s just real.</p>
<p>Shoko Nishimiya. This entire chapter comes from Shoko’s perspective. The complications that come from her disability also come with that perspective. When listening to the voices of others, their words are cut in half, and the spellings of those words are often incorrect. It’s a beautiful display of Shoko’s struggle, and the way that affects her everyday life. It’s difficult to interpret as a reader, and that difficulty only lends to a greater amount of sympathy for Shoko knowing this is what she experiences every day. It’s one of the best depictions of disability I’ve ever seen in manga. It creates this atmosphere of isolation around both the reader and Shoko. Every conversation feels distant. Hidden behind an extra layer of effort that requires the listener to input extreme focus and question their understanding of what is being said. It’s a disability that impacts her very ability to understand what is going on around her. In reflection, it explains and deepens her pain. All the moments where she had been left out, misunderstood, or hurt. The solitude of a life where understanding isn't reciprocated because of a genetic barrier placed between oneself and the people they want to connect with. The whole scene and idea as a whole is really heartbreaking. It speaks to Shoko’s strength. Her ability to persevere through such a difficult life, even if she did try to end it. Shoko regains her footing and makes an effort to keep striving forward, despite the difficulties she faces in her everyday life. Shoko, despite her disability, is able to connect the people around her: Even if she can’t hear their voices.</p>
<p>It feels like the perfect tie-in to bring in the series’ alternate English titles, “The Shape of Voice” and “A Silent Voice”. Both offer different views into the framing of the story, and specifically Shoko’s experience. “The Shape of Voice” speaks more to the complex nature of connection. The shape of a voice is the understanding that voice doesn't come solely from what someone says. Everything from their facial expressions to the guilt they carry with them is part of the shape of someone’s voice. It’s a great descriptor for how Shoko interprets the people around her. Since she can’t directly hear their voice, her understanding of their voice is more complex. A combination of all their different traits and quirks. The voice is not solely the way the brain gets its ideas out, but also the way it expresses itself and makes itself unique. The shape of a voice is so much more than a noise, it’s the life events and seconds leading up to every moment that make some the person they are. Many only listen to the sound of a voice instead of its shape; When in reality, the shape ironically often says more than the words do. What makes Shoko so special is that despite her inability to hear, she exhibits a higher level of emotional understanding and complexity than most people around her. Shoko herself hides behind the shape of her own voice. She has no voice to speak with, so she horses her true emotions behind the shape that it takes. Her acted smile being the main signifier of that fact. Shoko’s voice takes an entirely different form when layered behind her past and emotions. That shape is often misunderstood due to her reservedness, and the natural difficulty that comes from expressing feelings without spoken words. This often leaves Shoko unheard, or in how the series alternate title frames it “silent”.</p>
<p>“A Silent Voice” also holds a doubled meaning centering around Shoko. It first represents her physical silence. Shoko cannot communicate through traditional spoken language, so by definition, her voice is silent. Her silence acts as an emotional weight that hangs over her. Rather than speak up about what she’s going through, Shoko remains silent. Instead choosing to carry that weight on the inside. Silencing her voice and leaving her physically and emotionally separated from the people who love her. The title also represents how Shoko’s struggle goes unheard by the rest of her group. Even those who do hear her, Yuzuru, and to an extent Shoya, are unable to truly reach her. Shoko is pictured as voiceless, alone, and oftentimes ignored by the larger circle. Both her actual words, and her thoughts on the inside are silent to everyone else. A Silent Voice encapsulates the feelings one feels when alone. The voice to speak up and get help is often silenced by the very mind that conjured the idea. A voice that is silent still has something to say, but is usually unable to or afraid to say it. Shoko’s loudest emotions are carried by her in a quiet silence, making the title a symbol for her and the way she is able to interact with the people around her. <em>A Silent Voice</em> is more than a title, and more of a description of the central conflict of the story and the inability to express oneself honestly.</p>
<p>Shoko’s chapter then transitions into one of the most heartbreaking scenes in the entire manga. When visiting their old classroom with her friends, Shoko experiences a wave of reflection on her time at the school when she was younger. But the memories she reflects upon are wrong. They’re tainted. Marked a small waviness in the normally unwaveringly straight black lines that surround every panel on the manga. Her memories are fabricated, her true ones repressed under a layer of guilt, hurt, and fear. It’s reminiscent of the way Naoka had repressed the opposite memory. It all leads to what I believe is the biggest gut punch of the entire manga. As Shoko’s imagined day at school of happiness ends, she lays down in her bed with a big smile on her face. Only for time to return to the present where in the next panel we see current day Shoko laying in the same bed, but this time with a face full of tears. The transition is truly striking. Years of emotional trauma and pain written across her as the innocence and happiness is stripped from her being. Her hair three times the length, spread out messily on her pillow. An image that to me, communicates the burden that she’s carried all time. The hair, unkept, and untreated serves as a symbol for her trauma. Where her eyes were previously closed with a smile, they now stay wide open full of tears. We’ve all felt that feeling before. The feeling of being unable to go to sleep because of something weighing on the mind. Shoko’s eyes look heavy, saddened and just really break my heart. She looks void of life, almost like a corpse stuck staring at the ceiling. Her arms, previously positioned grabbing the edge of the sheets in joy, now lay almost limp. One in a sling, and the other over weakly her chest. The child pictured holds onto the sheets with anticipation for the day coming, but the Shoko of the present lays limp with nothing to hold onto. Shoko feels that her life is devoid of purpose and meaning. Even if most stories of this avenue will make it seem as if a victim is able to immediately recover after the climax and start life anew. This one shows the painful reality. That the pain doesn’t just fade away once she’s saved. It’s all still very real and present. Just because she was stopped from taking her own life doesn’t mean that she’s suddenly healed. The struggle is still ongoing, and in truth, it won’t ever go away. Yes there’s times when it’ll be less or almost nothing, but it’ll always be there. Shoko is still in the thick of hers and that’s a fact that needs to be recognized. Just because someone has a failed suicide attempt doesn’t mean they’re suddenly okay. Around 30% of people who survive a suicide attempt will end up trying again. This scene is where we see how that statistic becomes a reality. Shoko, still struggling with her feelings, lays alone in bed mulling over her guilt and anxieties alone. She’s reentering that cycle that brought her to that dark moment in the first place. She stares at the barren ceiling, then the calendar and the clock. Both symbols for time and the simple desire for it to stop for a while. Shoko needs a moment of rest, some time with the people she loves away from any sort of progress or external goals. She simply wants to recenter around the things that truly matter to her, but the clock keeps ticking. Time doesn’t wait for her problems, and that mounting pressure builds up inside her. It’s like an invisible force pushing you away and not letting you rest. I’ve felt it so many times before, the rejection of your own self-sympathy, and the societal want for you to just get back on the hamster wheel. Sometimes it’s okay to take a step off the wheel. To take a breath and slow down until you can refind yourself. Don’t let the world tell you how to live and when to do it. Live on your own schedule, your own time, and, most importantly, take care of your own mind, because, at the end of the day, that’s all you have.</p>
<p>What happens next has honestly really challenged me. Shoko experiences a dream in which she relives her and Shoya’s reunion, but instead of listening to their conversation, she is able to hear Shoya’s inner monologue during that moment. She hears his self-loathing and suicidal idealology. What’s striking about the moment is that it feels like it still applies today. These thoughts break Shoko, as Shoya seems to be deciding to leave her and his life behind. I think it’s meant to symbolize the internal battle that Shoya is going through during his coma. Shoya, faced with his own morality, has to either give in to its pressure, or find the courage to wake up and keep fighting. In her dream, Shoya decides to move on and leave Shoko to live out her own life. I don’t think these thoughts are actually felt by Shoya at the moment, but rather they are manifestations of Shoko’s fear. Her fear that Shoya will never wake up, and the solitary and hollow future that she feels awaits her on the other side of that reality. He says “Tuesday is almost over. See ya, Shoko.” The reference to Tuesday ending not only references the fact that at the time of the story Tuesday is literally ten minutes away from ending, but also the symbolic significance of the day. Throughout their relationship, Tuesday has stood as the day the group always gathered on, and has stood in the background as a motivator for many of the characters. Even when their wills were at their lowest, the reminder that another Tuesday laid ahead was able to carry them through. Tuesday ending means the end of that reminder, that comfort and assurance. Their connection would be severed. With no more Tuesdays to look forward to, Shoko feels lost and empty. He tells her “See ya” , a recurring quote in their relationship. Again, a character lies when they say “see ya”. In her dream, there is no next time. This is the end, and by leaving it open ended, it symbolizes Shoko’s desire for it not to end. Even if she feels or fears that Shoya is fading away, she desires him to stay. She was the first one to sue it, and she just simply wants that “see ya” to be reciprocated. She wants their connection and interactions to continue. He also noticeably turns back into his child self when he says this. To me, this feels like a symbol of what would happen if Shoya were to submit to his feelings of guilt and trauma from his past. If he lets that child version of himself continue to control him, then this is the final result. It also represents the retention of that child-like ignorance and innocence. In this dream, Shoya ignores the feelings of Shoko, instead prioritizing his own over the pain that those left behind might feel. Shoya’s child self has always been used to represent Shoya’s demons, the thoughts that hang over him, and the guilt that has micromanaged his every move thus far. By letting that child control him, Shoya loses. But luckily, Shoko’s dream is only a manifestation of her fears, rather than reality. She wakes up in shock and sets out, just as Tuesday is about to end, to right her and Shoya’s wrongs and change her world for the better.</p>
<p>Oima then delivers what is likely the most ambitious chapter in the entire story. Chapter 52: Silence. It’s a chapter with basically no words, hence its name. It operates as the shift for the story going forward, as Shoko reaches her lowest point, only for Shoya to wake up at the very end. This chapter’s story is told almost entirely through Shoko’s actions, emotions, and memories. She herself never says anything, but as a reader one can easily feel her pain and understand her tears. It begins with Shoko running in panic towards the bridge. She dodges cars and pushes her body to its limits. There’s this imagery of a tunnel of trees leading to a black void where the bridge would be that becomes the focus of her run. It’s shown five times in relatively quick succession, each time getting closer. It depicts the difficulty of Shoko’s journey as despite how hard she’s running, it barely becomes any closer as she runs. The darkness stands as a metaphor for not only her future, but specifically with Shoya. It lies at the point at which the bridge would become visible, but until she arrives it’s left obscured. The bridge has continuously stood as a symbol for connection in the manga, specifically that between Shoko and Shoya since their reuniting. But as Shoko runs towards that future with Shoya, it still remains unclear. Despite being so close to it, Shoko is still unsure of where her and Shoya relationship will go. She doesn’t know if he’ll ever wake up, let alone the uncertainty that waits on the other side of that moment. Despite that fact, Shoko trudges forward through her fears to see the future that awaits on the other side of that darkness.</p>
<p>Shoko arrives at the bridge in a first person panel, really emphasizing the want for the reader to step into Shoko’s shoes. Her emotions are being fully developed and displayed in this scene, so the initial first person perspective serves as a way for readers to try and further consider how Shoko must feel in this moment. She steps onto the bridge and begins to look around in panic. She looks at the various pots where members of the group would either sit or stand. Not void of life, the bridge’s emptiness unsettles and hurts Shoko. When she reaches the realization that she’s alone and that no one is coming. She feels that Tuesday is really over. That the group’s connection is broken, and that without Shoya, her life has lost all meaning. Her guilt begins to build, she feels that once again she's torn apart the group. Standing on the very thing that symbolizes connection, Shoko feels that she’s destroyed that very connection between the people she loves.It’s a truly painful emotion, and as she steps onto her usual spot on the bridge—the one where she and Shoya spent so much time together; feeding the ducks, chatting about various occurrences of life, and most importantly of all, learning to love one another—it all comes crashing down. She just breaks down. Shoko falls down to the ground in a heartbreaking stream of tears. But then, in Shoko fashion, she tries to stand and recompose herself. She tries to hide that pain like she has so many times before, but that won’t work. The emotions are too strong, and they find their way to overpower her. She first reflects on her communication notebook. The narrative’s other most important symbol for connection. It is constantly reemphasized in this scene. The importance of connection and understanding. It’s the most important message of the manga, and this scene expresses all the feelings that arise in the lack of it. She reflects on how attached she is to that notebook and what it stands for. Shoko finds meaning in her life through the people around her, and in one the best pages of the story, that’s what we see. All of Shoko’s friends, some of her favorite moments, and an emphasis on Shoya. Looking back one hat she had, and what she feels she’s lost, her tears all come back. She runs around in a frantic search. Desperately looking for anyone who can quell her fears, but in this moment, she realizes that she’s alone. She walks back to the bridge and succumbs to her emotions. Shoko, alone in the middle of the night, bawls her eyes out in the middle of the bridge. There’s this soul-crushing panel of Shoko crouched on the center of the bridge. It’s zoomed out in order to emphasize her isolation. She sits right in the center, detached from both sides, a place not irregular for her to hang out at, but this time, there’s no one there to connect her to the opposite sides of the road. At this moment, Shoko feels truly alone. Even after all the efforts she’s given to try and reconnect the group despite their differences, when she needs it most, no one is there to save her. Through this entire stretch of the story, Shoko serves as a catalyst for the other side characters to gain their own journeys of self discovery, but that helping hand is not reciprocated when she needs it. That isn’t a detriment to the other characters, but more of a tragic trend of Shoko’s character and those who try so hard to help others without giving the necessary attention to themselves. The focus on Shoko ends in this chapter as it dedicates a page to the fish swimming beneath the page. It’s a simple shot of a koi appearing close in focus, and then swimming away to join the rest of the group. In Japan, the koi fish stands as a symbol of courage and perseverance, and here, its presence is used to show that Shoko is not going to give up again. Despite the fact that she feels as low as she ever has, she’s not going to give into that sorrow. The koi keeps moving and joins the school swimming the other way. It works as a symbol that Shoko will get back on her feet, and she will have a refined connection. That moment may not be right now, but it will come. As long as she keeps fighting and refuses to give up, Shoko will find her happiness again. And luckily for her the chapter then ends with the reawakening of Shoya in a call out to the person he feels he needs to finally open up to and address as he yells “Choko” in his raspy dehydrated voice.</p>
<h2><strong>Part 7: See You Later</strong></h2>
<p>“Wings begin to emerge, breaking the cycle of feeling stagnant”</p>
<p>Chapter 53 opens with Shoya experiencing a parallel to the dream that Shoko had a few chapters ago. One where the past is distorted, where the ideal plays out and everything goes off without a hitch. But just like Shoko, Shoya is awoken by reality. Specifically, his desire to experience the future alongside his friends. It’s posed as this question of “I wonder if everyone is going to die?” to which he then frantically responds, “No, they can’t die!” I don’t think this moment is in direct reference to death itself, but rather a metaphor for his connection with his friends. When asking if everyone is going to die, the accompanying panel depicts Shoya’s friend group walking into the darkness away from him. A direct contrast to the repeated imagery of the last arc that continually showed his friends walking together into the light instead of the dark. He only realizes the error in this perspective when the white of the speech bubble is framed as emerging through the void of the darkness. The awakened Shoya represents one outside of that void. Someone that has recentered their world-view in a place that promotes progress and honesty over the hopeless spiral that he had previously set himself on.</p>
<p>The following escape from the hospital, and Shoya’s reunion with Shoko, reinforces the previous metaphor about reality. They both stare at each other in disbelief. Confusion that the other is even present before their eyes. There’s a certain shock combined with joy that they both share in this moment as they realize the imperativeness of it. They’ve both, in their own separate ways, been healing and preparing for this very moment. Both making their own attempt at becoming better people for the other, and both looking to apologize and move forward honestly. When reality sets in, it’s oftentimes very liberating, for some that brings pain, for others, and in this instance, it brings growth. This is Shoya’s greatest moment in the entire series—a true signal of his growth and the emergence of a self he can finally be proud to call “i.”</p>
<p>The same “i” that Kendrick Lamar comes to embrace in his own track of the same name. Kendrick’s journey of complex emotions and guilt circles back to the simple fact that if he is unable to love himself, then how can he love anyone or anything around him? It’s a realization that, once made, drives him to change his perspective. Instead of blaming himself for the world’s struggles, he chooses to embrace self-acceptance. By accepting himself for who he is, he’s able to move forward with renewed love for the world around him. His focus shifts away from his own imperfections and toward the beauty that surrounds him.</p>
<p>This is almost identical to the Shoya presented post-suicide attempt. This is a Shoya who accepts himself and his past for what it is: reality. He no longer internalizes his guilt, but acknowledges its existence and chooses to keep moving. No longer bound by shame or a foreign sense of obligation to memory, Shoya can now refer to himself not as “u,” but as “i.” Someone he’s proud of—an identity that no longer eats away at his soul.</p>
<p>When speaking about the track, Lamar said, “If you sit around moping, feeling sad and stagnant, it’s gonna eat you alive. I had to make that record. It’s a reminder. It makes me feel good.” “i” makes Kendrick feel free, and for Shoya, that same self-identification is what sets him free.</p>
<p>Their conversation on the bridge begins with apologies from both sides. This is one of the only times in the series where we don’t get a translation for Shoko’s singing. Previously, a character often repeated what she says, or it is directly clear from the response she is given. Here, it is less so. What she says isn’t exactly one hundred percent clear, and I think that’s the point. There's no need to simplify the conversation for the reader because this is meant to solely be a conversation between Shoko and Shoya. It’s their first moment of true understanding, and ironically the first moment where the reader may not be able to fully understand everything that is said. Shoya starts out with something that initially may seem small, but in reality is his biggest achievement and turning point for him: a genuine apology. Shoya admits fault for everything that he did to Shoko as a child. Shoya’s ability to openly admit to blame here, and most importantly, not let it eat away at him is what indicates his real growth. Adjacent scenes would normally see a flash to Shoya’s internal thoughts, where oftentimes he would be criticizing and hating himself. In this chapter, there’s not a single flash to Shoya’s thoughts, because for the first time in the series, he’s being and truly honest. Here’s no contemplative thoughts behind what he says, he just has an open and honest conversation with Shoko. Something that’s been needed since the moment they met up.</p>
<p>Shoya says, “I intended to listen to your voice, but really, it was nothing but intent.” It calls back on the idea of “A Silent Voice” the idea that while the voice is heard, it really isn’t understood. Shoya has been trying to listen to Shoko and her plight, but what he only realizes now, is that he must first listen to himself. Once Shoya is open with himself and comes to terms with the mind that he lives within, the voices around him become much clearer. Without his own internal monologue to block out their voices, Shoya is able to listen to Shoko and truly understand her.</p>
<p>He then states, "Of course there's more going on than what people choose to tell me, but I convinced myself that was all there was to a person." This quote brought to mind a word that I recently saw, one in the Dictionary of Obscure Sorrows called gnossienne. It’s defined as “a moment of awareness that someone you’ve known for years still has a private and mysterious inner life, and somewhere in the hallways of their personality is a door locked from the inside, a stairway leading to a wing of the house that you’ve never fully explored—an unfinished attic that will remain maddeningly unknowable to you, because ultimately neither of you has a map, or a master key, or any way of knowing exactly where you stand.” Shoya stood, whether consciously aware of or not, simply in the anterooms of Shoko’s mind. He admits that he was naive in his belief in Shoko’s mental well-being, that he doesn’t fully understand her and her struggle. But what matters is his honesty in that admission, and his efforts to change that standing. Shoya acknowledges that things went poorly and ended in a way they shouldn't have, but looking forward, he seeks to right those wrongs and to move forward in a future where misunderstandings can be avoided through pure openness and acceptance.</p>
<p>Shoya then blames himself for interpreting Shoko’s behavior in his own selfish way, even going so far as to take responsibility for her suicide attempt; something Shoko vehemently denies. Her emotions boil over, and she begins to cry. But Shoya tries to comfort her, saying, “I thought the same thing. But still, like it wasn’t worth dying for.” It’s a realization that had escaped them both for so long, but now finally becomes clear: they’ve been struggling with the same emotions: guilt, blame, and the isolation that fed into their suicidal ideologies. This shared pain is the central parallel the entire series revolves around. And in this moment, they finally understand it together — that no one is ever truly alone. Even though they felt isolated in their suffering, they were unknowingly walking the same emotional path. Once they’re able to put that fact in context, their correlative experiences become much clearer. They’re two sides of the same coin, born of the same terrible experience — and living proof that one’s past doesn’t determine their future, but simply contextualizes it.</p>
<p>They then share a really beautiful and quiet moment where Shoya begins to cry and says, “I really don’t want you to cry, but if crying solves anything, I want you to cry.” I previously touched on my opinions on crying, and its healing and resonant power, but I loved that it's deliberately expressed here. A male figure openly crying, not as the brunt of a comedic moment or a signifier of his weakness, but rather his strength. In Western media especially, male figures showing tears are often mocked and shamed. The age-old “I’m not crying” as they sniffle away tears and hide their emotions is extremely overdone and honestly tiring. It’s refreshing to see depictions of vulnerable male characters. Real characters who don’t hide their emotions, but rather express them honestly for the people they love. It teaches a valuable lesson about genuineness and emotional well-being. It’s those toxic depictions that drive men into believing they can’t open up about their feelings, leaving them feeling isolated with their thoughts. But characters like Shoya show that emotions aren’t something to be afraid of or to hide. They are simply extensions of one’s self and feelings. Crying is often seen as something sad or an indication of pain, but here, crying is made out to be a healing force. An outlet for the complex emotions that they both carry in this moment, and a simple way to release the years and years of pent-up anxiety and trauma. Crying isn’t the solution to their problems, but it shows authenticity and lets each other know that this space is safe and judgment-free.</p>
<p>We then get what I believe to be the greatest moment in the entire manga, and one of my favorite lines in all of media: “If there is something I need to do starting today, it’s to hang out with everyone more. And chat a lot and goof around. I want you to help me with that. I want you to help me live.” This line is the ethos of Koe no Katachi. Everything this story is about — and the thing that changed my life. Learning to live through and with others. Shoya realizes that the value in his life lies in the simple moments he shares with those close to him. He vocalizes his wish to spend his life creating memories with the people he loves — and more specifically, with Shoko. There isn’t any romantic intent behind this statement. Just an admission of his honest feelings and hopes for the future.</p>
<p>It ties back to one of Shoko’s central character themes: reliance. For her whole life, Shoko has felt like she’s been relying on the help of others. She’s felt like a burden — constantly judged or pitied for her circumstances. But here, Shoya expresses his desire to rely on her. He doesn’t filter his view of her through her disability or past, but addresses her sincerely, from a place of emotional truth. For one of the first times in her life, Shoko is seen not as a product of her deafness or of bullying, but simply as a human being.</p>
<p>It’s one of the most beautiful expressions of love in any series — let alone manga. What Shoya proposes here, whether knowingly or not, is a relationship formed not out of sexual desire or dependency, but a genuine desire to experience the joys of life with someone he cares about. It’s the realization of all of Shoya’s efforts to change. In this moment, he finds himself free — free from the guilt of his past, free from the anxiety that once held back his words, and free to experience life with a new perspective: one that sees the present not as a distortion of the past, but as a simple gift — offered by the people around him who make it worth living.</p>
<p>Shoko gives him her first genuine smile since his fall, and for the first time in the story, it feels like everything is going to be okay. It puts a big smile on my face just writing about it. Truly one of the best written scenes in the history of the medium. It’s extremely rewarding as a reader, and makes all the frustration from Shoya’s inhibitions finally pay off. The quietness of much of the chapter lends to a greater emotional resonance and realism. The quotes and actions feel real, and are an excellent expression of what the healing process truly feels like. It’s the chapter that made me fall in love with Oima’s writing, and more specifically her ability to express emotional realism through her characters. For me, a life changing chapter, and one that’s helped me keep my head on through life’s tumultuousness. Go find the people in your own life that help you live, and let them know. It’s conversations like this one that breed trust and attachment, and let the people around us know that they are valued and loved.</p>
<p>Learning to live through others isn’t a burden upon them, but rather an honor. Boris Pasternak once wrote, “And so it turned out that only a life similar to the life of those around us, merging with it without a ripple, is genuine life, and that an unshared happiness is not happiness…” In this moment, Oima captures that same truth. This scene triggered a change within my own life, and brought me to the same realization that Christopher McCandless came to when he read that original passage after spending months alone in the Alaskan wilderness, that “happiness is only real when shared.”</p>
<p>After this moment, the story enters its resolution. It begins with Shoya trying to reconnect with everyone—and, in his mind, apologize for everything. He reflects and realizes he hasn’t seen any of them since his breakdown on the bridge. It’s a deeply relatable feeling, and one that’s often hard to confront: the fear of facing people you feel you’ve hurt. That lingering anxiety that maybe things won’t be the same, or that you don’t deserve their kindness anymore. But in places where I’ve struggled with the apprehension that comes along with that, Shoya shows his courage. He tells Shoko, “Yeah, tell them. But tell them this: I’ll come see them.” By placing the responsibility and act of reaching out upon himself, it forces him to face his fears and himself. If he simply waits around for them to come to him, he may never be able to rekindle those relationships. Maybe out of fear or just a simple preference for comfortability. It’s oftentimes difficult to go out of your circle and actively seek out new relationships. But by showing his willingness to approach that difficult situation, it shows the others that he’s ready to be honest, and ready to heal. Reaching out is hard, but many times, when a relationship is broken, that’s all it takes to mend it.</p>
<p>There’s a following scene where the Nishimiyas come over to eat dinner with Shoya and his mom. It’s one with a lot of underlying tension as the Nishimiyas make an effort to “repay” the Ishidas for Shoya’s kindness and fall. Yaeko in particular comes off very forcefully as she tries to get Miyako to accept her gift and address the seriousness of the situation. I like this little moment where Shoya glances towards Shoko and notes that she’s lost weight. It shows his growth from where he was before in life. Where previously he would’ve blamed himself for the anxiety that he had caused her, and subsequent weight loss, here he focuses on what he can do now. He doesn’t make a scene out of it or address it outright, he just simply encourages everyone to eat more. A noticeable change in demeanor and positive change towards acting in the present, rather than trying to make up for the past.</p>
<p>Shoya lets a little of his lasting damage from the fall show, and it breaks down much of the conversation. All of the Nishimiyas attempt to apologize, and Yaeko and Miyako get into an argument as Miyako tries to argue that she just wants to relax, rather than fight over the past. It’s a very difficult situation to address. Because while Yakeo is right that this is very much a serious conversation that needs to be had. Yakeo is not wrong in wanting to just knock the edge off. To cool down after what must’ve been an extremely stressful few weeks. Where the balance between those two sides lies isn’t defined. There’s no formula for how long one can take before simply wanting to move on for the betterment of their mental state. Thinking about and addressing past actions or events is in no way a bad thing. I mean that’s what this story is all about. But as also shown in the story, thinking about it too much can be just as detrimental as not thinking about it at all. There’s a point somewhere in the middle where one must force themselves to at least partially move on. Where the point is is different for everyone. No two people grieve the same, but we must all make the attempt to acknowledge other people’s grief and their way of dealing with things. It may not always align with how you would’ve done it, but you owe it to yourself, and to them to let them heal in their own unique way.</p>
<p>Once told to leave to let them discuss it, Shoya says, “They must have a lot to talk about. I hope they can knock down all the walls between them.” It circles all the way back to the beginning and “These Walls”. After all this time and progress, those walls still remain, and honestly they always will. Nobody ever truly puts down their walls, but they reach a state where they feel most comfortable with the least amount of barriers on their personality. The moment ends in a comedic scene where the two parents end up having fun with and joking around with one another after a few drinks, but the message still applies. Shoya looks up to their carefreeness acknowledging that he’s not at that point in his life yet, but with more work he’ll be able to lay back and forget about his problems for a while. It’s less in their ability to drink, but more in the act of applying oneself fully to a conversation and moment without being held back by emotions or apprehensions. It’s refreshing to see the respective parents finally let loose. They’ve both been so pent up and anxiety filled since each of their children’s mental health battles, but now that things are out in the open and somewhat resolved they can finally calm down. It’s reminiscent of the feeling that resides over this entire section of the story: simple fun. Everyone feels free whether from their own internal battle or someone else's, every character is free to make progress on their own and finally experience the world. The story shows its readers what life can be at its most fun. I’ve always felt a little weird about the comedic tone that hangs over the resolution of this story. I think it’s a good break from the serious that came from Shoko’s suicide attempt and the fallout of that event, but it’s a shift that I feel is a little too harsh. While the story does still hit its points on the more serious topics, these few chapters after Shoko and Shoya’s conversation feel jarringly light hearted. Maybe I’m too serious of a reader, or maybe it’s intentional. I’m not sure, just something to point out.</p>
<p>In the next chapter, Shoya resolves to go to his school festival and make good on all the promises and resolves that he’s made ever since Shoko’s suicide attempt. But oftentimes, it’s easier to resolve oneself than it is to actually carry out that action. When Shoya arrives at school he’s struck with the same fear and anxiety that he felt previously, if not only amplified due to his time away. It’s entirely natural, but bound to cause some self-doubt as he’s spent the last few weeks telling himself that he’d change. And come face to face with the situation where he thought he’d change for good. He initially fails. But Shoko then proposes an alternate path forward. She offers to pull him along behind her. Offering her own strength as a crutch for Shoya to get back on his feet. It’s her way of keeping up on her promise to “help him live.” But in this moment, there’s a small reference back to Shoko’s aversion to physical touch. He offers his hand, but she looks startled and instead chooses to grab his sleeve just like before. I love this little moment and the others that are like it. It grounds Shoya’s character and makes sure that his growth doesn’t come off as sudden or unearned, but rather a gradual process that he continuously works on throughout the entirety of the story. If Shoya was suddenly able to just face everyone and be perfect without any aspect of struggle it would hurt his entire character arc and really damage the realism that Oima attempts to portray in his character. But she avoids that here, and delivers on a situation that feels genuine and heartfelt. Tying together multiple previous plot threads seamlessly into a small moment that reflects and plays into the larger underlying developing narrative.</p>
<p>As for the movie itself, it’s probably the biggest challenge I’ve faced in the writing of this essay so far. It feels like such an obvious parallel to Shoya’s situation in specific, but it’s hard to pin a specific point on how exactly that tie appears and what it means for his character. It starts with a clever line that says, “If my rotten life is heavier than my rotten future, please serve this rope.” I like the play on words here between the idea of his actual weight breaking the rope on top of the idea that if his future is lighter than his past, then it’s a life he would still want to experience. It’s underlined with the fact that he calls both of his futures “rotten”, but still leaves the possibility of life open. The same thoughts probably passed through both Shoya and Shoko’s minds as the debated suicide, but luckily they were both granted a brighter future than the regrettable past that lay behind them.</p>
<p>The film then presents a scene where its suicidal main character transports back in time to stab his childhood bully. But even after doing what he felt would redeem his life, he ends up in the same situation with the same thoughts all over again. This is the moment that I found hardest to interpret. On one hand, it feels like a representation of Shoko and her desire to distance herself and the bullying. I was initially drawn to this idea because of the fact that the character in the film was bullied himself and was going back to eliminate that from happening. But after further thinking, I actually believe that the childhood bully that is stabbed is rather a representation of Shoya’s younger self and his past. I think it’s a direct callback to chapter 23 where Shoya is depicted stabbing a younger version of himself. The movie depicts Shoya’s journey and the respective paths that he could’ve taken. The “Shoya” in the film eliminates his past, he forgets it and refuses to reflect upon it. Later in life, he is then met with that same depressive life that he once tried to run from.</p>
<p>Then, in an almost one-to-one parallel to Shoya, the film’s protagonist, noose in hand, says, “I want to go to some place where there’s no one around.” The god in the film grants that wish, kicking the stool out from under him as he dies by hanging. This scene is used to show what would have happened to Shoya if not for the support of his friends. Shoya was in that same exact situation, following an identical thought pattern. But where the film’s protagonist is alone, Shoya was able to recover with the help of his friends. Before the protagonist dies, his old friend that he stabbed comes to his side, coming to prove his friendship. I think that represents the importance of Shoya’s past—the way that it has changed him, and the fact that without it, he wouldn’t be nearly as strong of a person as he is today. By embracing his past and addressing it properly, Shoya avoids the reality presented in the film, instead forging his own path forward through love and the support of those around him. The film ends with the protagonist waking back in the first reality after the noose snapped under his weight, presenting him with his wish, as he is back in a place where he is truly alone. The experience of having committed suicide in the other reality now leaves him the perspective to realize that he had been leading his life incorrectly. Presumably, from the end of the film, the main character goes to reunite with his old friend and mend their relationship, likely following the same path that Shoya did after reuniting with Shoko. It’s a really fun microcosm of the story as a whole and teaches and applies the lessons learned throughout the manga into a short silent film that acts as a way of recentering Shoya and showing him how much progress he has made.</p>
<p>A notable realization comes from Shoya during the film as he realizes that it’s silent so that Shoko would be able to understand it. He says, “See? There are still things out there I don’t know. There are many things I have yet to notice.” Shoya acknowledges that he hasn’t fully evolved. He’s yet to become the person he truly wishes to be, but he’s able to recognize that he’s making progress on that journey, and that’s what matters. We may never fully achieve the version of ourselves that we wish to be, but if we make an effort to be more like that person everyday, then months or years down the line we’ll be able to look back and be proud of the person we’ve become. Even if it isn’t the perfect idealized version we always wished to be, because in reality, that’s impossible.</p>
<p>At the end of the film and chapter, Shoya, albeit unknowingly, overcomes his social anxiety as he yells out into the crowd of his friends, complimenting their work. The thing that once stood in Shoya’s way of reaching out to Yuzuru back on the bridge, now serves as the method to which he reintroduces himself to his friend group. He shouts out not in anger or fear, but rather in joy, attempting to rekindle and fix the relationships that he felt he had broken.</p>
<p>“Finally free, the butterfly sheds light on situations that the caterpillar never considered, ending the internal struggle”</p>
<p>Once the lights come on and everyone sees that Shoya is back, he quickly reinstates his x’s over everyone’s faces and runs to the bathroom to hide. Shoya crawls back into his comfort zone when faced with his most challenging social interaction. It’s only natural for someone like him. He’s quick to be controlled by fear, and is still in his journey to finding out how he can live with his anxiety without letting it be a detriment to his daily life. But in all the areas where Shoya has failed, he’s succeeded in finding a group of people who unconditionally support him. Tomohiro convinces Shoya to come out of the bathroom and face his friends. The paneling and framing of this scene may just be the series’ best. Every shot obscures the other’s faces focusing on Shoya and his inability to look them in the eyes. The shots focus on the others’ feet along with Shoya’s back, exemplifying Shoya’s anxiety, fear, and inaction. Shoya is simply afraid to face the people who he knows he hurt. He believes that they all still hold that grudge against him and he needs to come forward and regain their trust, but in reality everyone has gone through their own journey of self-improvement, leaving those feelings in the past.</p>
<p>As he finds the strength to face each of his friends one by one, he sees that there’s no ill-will. No contempt or anything resembling it. Instead he’s met with love and support. Each person has their own way of showing that. Tomohiro’s mustache, Miki’s cranes, everyone grieves differently, and the ways in which they show Shoya the love that they individually have for him comes out in this scene. Tensions momentarily rise when an argument between Naoka and Miki arises that results in Miyoko getting pushed to the ground by Naoka. But where before, it evolved into a fight and separated them, Miyoko, after having undergone her growth while Shoya was asleep, instead chooses progress. Ignoring the circumstance and instead choosing to use it as a moment to reflect upon their inability to change despite everything that happened. To which Shoya, dropping the x’s from their faces, says one his most important lines, “There are some things you just can’t change. I know that all too well. I think it’s the time you spend trying to change that’s more important.” It serves as a resolution to Miyoko’s struggle through her chapter and also reflects some of the progress Shoya has made since his fall. He recognizes that his past will always be a part of him, and that he can never change it. But with the power of the present Shoya can attempt to become a better person, one not ashamed of who he once was, but proud of who he is now. It echoes Undertale’s most famous quote, “Despite everything, it’s still you.” That no matter how you falter or fail, who or what you lose, you will always be you. Nobody can take that away from you, and in this moment Shoya becomes content with that fact. There’s no point in running from himself, because he still has an entire life to live inside that body. Shoya, while maybe not proud of who he used to be, finds the courage to be happy with who he is now, scars and all.</p>
<p>Some of Naoka’s arc is even closed off here in a quick way as Shoya thanks her for staying by his side, but again fails to recognize her feelings for him. Naoka said before that she’d rather Shoya never wake up if he wasn’t going to choose her, and in this scene, she reveals how much of a lie that was. She’s embarrassed by Shoya's compliment, and everything returns to the way their relationship has been since the beginning of the series. I feel like here Naoka realizes that she has to form her own path forward. Shoya is never going to reciprocate her feelings, and that’s okay. It doesn’t mean that she’s lost or purposeless. It just simply means that she must find a new goal to chase. Shoya can still serve as a means of happiness and light in her life. He’s never going to stop supporting her despite his lack of romantic feelings for her. Naoka always runs from her emotions, but this moment really leaves with no other option but to finally acknowledge herself, her feelings, her future, and who she wants to be. The result of that is addressed later, but it’s set up here.</p>
<p>Then Shoya delivers his defining line, post-fall, the one that shows his new life goals, and the way he now views the world. He says, “Thank you. And I’m sorry for saying such hurtful things when there’s so much I don’t know about you. I want to learn more about all of you. So I want us to stay friends from now on. I want us to have fun and to fight.” Shoya does so much at this moment. He first recognizes his own faults with honest eyes, something he’s continuously struggled to do. Rather than overblowing his mistake, he addresses it as is, choosing to apologize and move forward rather than endlessly debating and criticizing himself. He then turns that mistake into a positive by recognizing the face that he’s yet to truly learn about all his friends. Turning a setback into a way to propose his want to spend more time with everyone. Then finally, to seal his progress, he admits to the fact that not everything is perfect. He looks forward to not only the fun, but the fights as well. Realizing that life isn’t going to be perfect, but that that won’t stop him from enjoying the time he gets to spend in it. This is a fully realized Shoya. The Shoya that the series has been building towards from its very first chapter, and the moment where everything finally feels resolved. Now more than ever Shoya is truly free. Free from the weight of his past, the weight of his guilt, and free to experience the present as a gift alongside the people he loves.</p>
<p>The chapter ends as Shoya enters the festival, choosing to look everyone in the eyes and listen to their voices. He ignores a hurtful comment, opting not to dwell on it but instead just having fun in the moment; something the old Shoya would have never done. As the x’s on everyone inside the festival fall to the ground, Shoya walks forward with his friends. Having completed his journey of introspection, he finds the ability to face the world as it is. Finally free from the shackles that controlled his everyday life, Shoya immerses himself fully in the moment: no over-analyzation, no self-doubt or guilt, just a pure experience with the people who drive him to wake up every day. After 57 chapters, Shoya finally achieves his goal: he looks everyone in the eyes, he lives in the present, and at long last, he truly feels happy.</p>
<p>This scene is where the film adaptation of the manga ends, and it makes me cry almost every time. It’s slightly different in the movie; it ends with him crying at the festival as he looks around, realizing that he’s finally achieved the end goal of all his hard work. It’s accompanied by the beautiful track “lit(var),” which not only adds to the emotional resonance but also leaves the viewer reflecting on their own life as the credits begin to roll, its crescendo being one of the few occurrences in any song that I’ve ever listened to that left a lasting impact on me not through lyrics or storytelling, but through the simple power of noise. One so intricate and carefully articulated that it stays in your mind years afterwards. One of those moments that you can hear no matter where you are. The type of song that lasts a lifetime. Truly amazing.</p>
<p>I think this scene is the movie’s greatest accomplishment, and what really makes it stand out from the manga. Overall, it’s a failure of an adaptation, but where it shines, it shines so bright. This is one of the most emotionally evocative scenes in any form of media: inspiring, heartbreaking, and joyous all at the same time. It’s one of those moments that makes you cry for reasons you can’t quite put your finger on. It’s probably my favorite scene in film history, and it cemented my belief that this was one of the greatest stories ever told the first time I saw it. If you haven’t seen the film in a while, or haven’t seen it at all, go and watch it just for this moment. Truly one of the greatest pieces of work ever put together, and a genuine masterpiece that changed my life.</p>
<p>In all honesty, it feels a little futile to keep going through the story. While there are definitely moments that I think are important to the story’s overall message, namely Naoka’s final moments along with the ending, the rest of the remaining five chapters feel like they pail in comparison to the previous scene. They’re mostly used to put some final bows on characters and give Shoya and Shoko the necessary ending they deserve. But having just seen Shoya overcome his biggest obstacle, some of it falls a little short of the drama that we as readers just went through. I think these chapters are important in creating a satisfying ending, but maybe the problem I feel with them actually lies in the placement of them after the festival rather than their actual content. But all that being said, I’m still going to dive into them, find what I can and give my favorite story the sendoff it deserves.</p>
<p>The first of these chapters we get is the culmination of the film’s creation when it is shown at a local film festival. At this festival, the group’s movie is harshly criticized through its every detail. To the group, its soul crushing. Everything they worked for, all their hard work, rejected by someone who fails to recognize the thought put into it. They almost succumb to that cycle of hatred when they begin blaming each other for the film’s faults. They shift that uncomfortable blame onto others, showing that even after the growth they’ve undergone, under pressure and negativity, it’s always easy to revert to a worse version of oneself. Shoya tries to show his strength by stopping their fighting and reaffirming his belief in them, but it’s all invalidated when Kazuki speaks to him for the first time since the carnival. He asks Shoya, “Do you really want to be acknowledged by those pieces of shit?” Something that I think is a stroke of brilliance in Oima’s writing. It would be easy for her to take this final act of the story as a victory lap. Everyone achieves what they want, and Shoya’s new perspective lends itself to greater experiences and growth. But that’s not what she does. Here she identifies another issue laying underneath Shoya’s surface: his need for external validation.</p>
<p>Shoya, after having found that much of the value in his life lies in his friends, has come to rely on their support and approval. So when he’s faced with a situation where someone outwardly disapproves of both him, his friends, and their work, he’s unable to properly address it. Kazuki, while blunt, is right. He doesn’t provide Shoya with the message he needs, but rather the question for him to find it himself. It’s so easy to fall into that trap where you feel reliant on how others think of you. Trapped within their walls of judgement, unable to form your own opinions on your sense of self. I’m not saying that Shoya exactly falls into that here, but it’s where he’s leaning. Shoya knows that the opinion of that film director means absolutely nothing about his own value or how that affects his relationship with his friends. But the group allows it to get under their skin. And when that negativity gets inside your brain, it begins to rot. It infests all parts of your mind, and when you allow it to spread, it finds a home right next to your ego and attaches itself to it. Your self-perception becomes tied to what other people think and say about you. It’s why they begin to tear each other apart in an attempt to escape that pressure. That negativity that creeps in and refuses to leave. But what Hazuki reminds Shoya of here, is that none of that matters. At the end of the day, “you’re you and that’s enough.” No amount of outside approval or validation can negate the intrapersonal progress that everyone, Shoya included, has made. And it’s in the realization of that fact that everyone is able to gain a true perspective on the situation. This was a creative effort used to rekindle their friendship. What anyone else thinks of it is irrelevant. What matters is making art for you. Don’t create for someone else’s approval or compliment. Art is an expression of one’s own soul, so make that art for the person that needs it most, you. Fuck what anyone else says, create your own path, and create what makes you feel whole. Everything else will fall in place, just enjoy yourself.</p>
<p>The chapter ends with everyone getting food and Shoko showing a big smile and laugh that really lightens the mood and signals Shoko’s readiness to evolve. Having been freed from her previous issues, it’s time for something new. New challenges, new experiences, and most importantly new fun alongside the people she loves. The future isn’t always easy, but being able to smile in the face of any adversity shows her own personal progress and readiness to fight those problems. It’s a person, that as Yuzuru looks at, she tears up, knowing her sister is finally free to be herself and enjoy the world for what it is. One of those small moments that justifies the journey so far and makes you happy to have been along for the ride. A beautiful story, with something so simple to say about the nature of happiness and what it means to find it.</p>
<p>The next chapter is entitled “The Future”. Its opening deals with Miyoko, Naoka, and Yuzuru’s respective futures. Miyoko and Naoka pursuing their fashion careers in Tokyo, Yuzuru taking the initial steps to return to school. It feels like everyone is going on their separate paths, pursuing their own interests and passions. It’s something I’ve felt all personally recently. It;s been a while since I started writing this, but as of right now I’m about to graduate. Everyone has their own college, their own path, and future ahead of them. And looking around, it feels like everyone is splitting all too quickly. There’s no chance to savor that goodbye as it fades before your eyes. It’s sad, but exciting, and horrifying all at the same time. This scene encapsulates that feeling for me. Everyone is excited about where they’re going and what they’re doing, but as they turn to look back, it feels like the world is starting to crack apart. It’s that delicate balance between being happy for everyone, but also being sad that you can’t spend that future alongside them. Nothing can last forever, but it’s in the time that we do get to spend together that we find the value of that impermanence.</p>
<p>Shoya is then faced with a new challenge when Shoko tells him that she’s thinking of moving to Tokyo to pursue hairdressing. It’s something that he initially freaks out over telling her that she can't do it and that she needs to stay close. It comes from a place of genuine care and worry for her best, but it comes out incorrectly. That care is often misconstrued as he comes off trying to inhibit her progress and dedication to pushing herself. It’s a scene that I really related to on re-read. Following a similar path to Shoko and moving to the city as someone who’s been reserved for most of their life, people are quick to doubt my decision. Seeing me as incapable of surviving in such an environment. And in the same way I can see where the emotions come from in Shoya, I can see where it comes from in the people in my own life. It’s fear, it’s worry, and it’s a want for me to stay comfortable and safe, but sometimes you have to push yourself beyond your comfort zone. Push yourself to do something you from a year ago would’ve thought crazy. And in that exploration, it’s often that you’ll learn more about yourself and become closer to finding what you really want. Maybe that new challenge isn’t exactly for you, but by pursuing that challenge, you found out something new about yourself. And that information is invaluable. Learning what you do and don’t like, chasing the wonders of the world, and always being in pursuit of a life more fulfilling and happy than the one you live now. That’s why I’ve pushed myself, and I think Shoko shares the same ideology</p>
<p>And funnily enough, in the way that it always tends to, it circles back to Etika. He once said, “We all feel depression. We all go through those struggles. But the thing is, is that you have people in your circle that disencourage you — that make you feel like shit, that tell you one thing, make you feel like your life isn't going in the right direction. But what if your direction is different from theirs? But they just don't know that, so they presume you're doing the wrong thing. But in reality, you're setting yourself up for something amazing in your future. Fuck their future. Fuck what they did. Fuck their path. Make your own path. You can do it. Nobody can stop you. The only thing stopping you is you.” He always found a way to dilute the most complex struggles down into such simple words. Shoko embodies his words here. Shoko creates her own path and ignores the negative voices around here. By following her own desires, Shoko approaches her own future. Not one dictated by the people around her, or her disability, but by her own passion and desire to live a life she can be proud of.</p>
<p>Shoya is shocked by not only Shoko’s decision, but also Yuzuru and his mother’s calmness surrounding the situation. They recognize that this is an opportunity for growth for Shoko, not something to be afraid of. Changing oneself is often scary. It involves things that are beyond the confines of one’s own comfort or or current ability. It involves failing, learning, retrying, and failing all over again. From the outside it may look as though someone is doing the wrong thing, but internally, that failure means progress. Yuzuru says that she’s not upset with Shoko’s decision because “I think the old sis would have just quietly chosen to stay near home.” Yuzuru recognizes that change in decision making and demeanor as a positive. Not something to be afraid of as Shoya initially views it. The voices around you will always try to keep you in their box. What they perceive you as being, but when you change, oftentimes their box does not. You must first break through that box and challenge their ideas in order to get them to recognize the version of yourself that you wish to be.</p>
<p>Shoya echoes this very idea when he wakes up in the morning of the next chapter. He realizes that by placing Shoko into his box, he was being selfish. He just doesn’t want her to go because he wishes to spend more time with her. But he recognizes that in order to let her grow, he must first let her go — to chase her dreams and wants, to find what she does and doesn’t like, to realize her own emotions, and to discover her own future. Shoya’s mother also says a line that I feel really echoes my sentiments toward college as a whole. When proposing the idea of Shoya going to Tokyo with Shoko, she says, “It’s not like there’s anything else you want to do, is there? Don’t worry about the money. Just do as you like.” I think it’s an idea more people should take into consideration — simply following your gut and passions and finding a place that makes you feel like you. So many people try to skew it and make it about the money, when in reality, college is about learning: learning about the marvels of the world, and learning about oneself. And by trapping that self inside a barrier — whether that be money, distance from home, or any other reason — it inhibits the physical, psychological, and social growth that can come from a truly meaningful college experience. Who cares about the money? Go be you and realize your own dreams. Because at the end of the day, that’s all that matters — you.</p>
<p>Shoko even falls into this trap after deliberating on her conversation with Shoya the day previous. It’s so easy to psyche oneself out of doing something challenging, especially when there’s people around feeding that very idea. Shoya, unsure of how to respond to her, decides to check in with his friends for some other opinions, where he sees the spectrum of college decisions and the various situations that lead to them. Shoya, like many others who feel needed at their home, has never even thought about leaving. It’s a sad reality, but when a child is needed in the household — whether due to a missing parent, financial situation, or any other reason — those children often get trapped in the same situations that leave their kids in the same one they face now. Tomohiro says that he’s going to film school. An idea that on the surface seems misguided. After creating a failed film, he decides to pursue a career in it? It seems stupid, but I think it’s the correct decision. He decides to reject the beliefs of others and solely follow what he believes to be his path in life. Chasing his dream of being a film director, and in the process doing the thing that makes him happy to be alive. Maybe he won’t become an esteemed film director, who knows? But what he will do is go and do what he loves, and in that process he’s bound to find the future meant for him. Maybe it’s not exactly what he thinks at the moment, but he’s setting himself up for a happy future, which is all he can do in this situation.</p>
<p>Satoshi, on the other hand, is less sure of his future. After his introspection he underwent during his chapter a while back, he’s unsure of his decision of becoming a teacher. His motives were untrue to himself, and faced with his entire life before him, he was unsure of what he really wanted. And that’s totally okay. It’s so difficult to make one decision that determines the rest of an entire lifetime. But truthfully it never does. He, or anyone else struggling with a career path, can always pivot. The world isn’t some rigid pathway that doesn't allow change. Obviously coming to that decision earlier has its benefits, but coming to it later in no means is a bad thing. Everyone learns about themselves at different paces. Not all the information needed is always available when it comes time to make a big decision. So you make the best decision you can, and remain unafraid to face something new if the need arises. Finding your dreams is a difficult process, never be discouraged if it isn't readily obvious or if others achieve theirs before you. Everyone is here to live their own life, just try your best to live the best one you can.</p>
<p>Miki has a different perspective on the matter. She chooses to go to the college that Satoshi is going to, just out of her desire to be with him. A decision that I think is likely misguided. Miki’s life is so dependent on the people around her. She never looks at or considers what she wants, instead choosing to appease and catering solely to the people around her. It’s why she’s so obsessed with other’s opinions, and why she’s the flattest character in the entire series. She says that it’s truly what she wants when Satoshi tells her that, “You should do what you want to do.” Something I find myself often telling people when debating over the matter. Maybe I’m wrong and this will end up working out for the both of them, I don’t know. But I think that when making this type of decision, she should first prioritize herself and what she wants over anyone else. This is her chance to finally learn who she really is, and she passes it up to further attach herself to Satoshi. A final indication of her refusal to change, and her role as the character that we should all strive to avoid becoming like as we grow up.</p>
<p>There’s also a really small scene with Shoya and his mother where she again reflects the ideas I’ve been trying to carry as I face the same decision that the characters in the story do. He asks her why she decided to become a hairdresser, and she simply responds, “Well it looks fun, doesn’t it?” I love this line so much. She disregards everything — any overly complex forward thought, debates over future salary or growth opportunity — none of it. She simply did it because it looked fun. She chose to do the thing that would make her happy and let her laugh and smile every day. Because when she looks back on her life, she’s not going to remember her biggest paycheck or bonus, but the times she smiled and shared with others. Prioritize the memories and fun over monetary concerns, and the future will work itself out. And of course, to end out, I have another quote from Etika that surmises this topic and all my thoughts on the matter,“If you supply the hearts of the world with happiness, whether it be through entertainment, products, or service, then wealth is an afterthought. Always focus your efforts on supplying happiness to more hearts of the world, not money itself. Those hearts help ensure your wealth!”</p>
<p>Yuzuru also decides to make a change. For so long Yuzuru has spent all her time worrying about her sister. Thinking of how to help or how to protect her. Even after the suicide attempt, Yuzuru doesn’t get a standalone chapter about her making change, she simply supports Shoko from the side. But here we see that she has undergone her own change as well. Yuzuru, having returned to school, exhibits renewed resolve and courage. She fights not only to show Shoko that she’s okay, but also for herself. Showing herself that she’s made out for the world and that there’s nothing to be afraid of. By both sisters pushing themselves to new things that they previously thought scary or impossible, they give the other the strength to do the same in their own life. Although their paths may push them in different directions, they show each other that the future isn’t to be feared when they face it together. Both share a degree of fear for their sibling, but they both recognize that this is what’s necessary for the both of them in order to grow and improve themselves.</p>
<p>Chapter 61, “Graduation”, which funnily enough I happen to be writing about on the day of my high school graduation as well. Something about this story, about this essay, it all felt fated from the beginning. Like I was meant to be here. Meant to write this. Meant to love this stupid little story about communication. I don’t know, I’ll leave the more personal writing for the end, but I just wanted to say that I love this manga. It feels like a part of me. Something about all this has felt bigger than me. Bigger than my simple life or this little essay. Just proud to be here writing this today. Thanks for reading all my nonsense.</p>
<p>But onto the actual chapter, it first deals with the final wrap up of Naoka’s character. The character who’s arc feels the most natural. She’s honest and she’s flawed. Even here where we get her final motivations and answers, she’s by no means perfect. There’s some things that she’s still wrong about, but that’s who Naoka is, and that’s okay. She centers her conversation on the idea that there are three things Shoya doesn’t know about. The first is that he’s wrong about Shoko’s want to be a hairdresser vs a beautician. It shows that there’s still things Shoya doesn’t know about Shoko. That there’s still more to learn, more to experience. Their relationship is just beginning, and the future looks infinitely bright for them. Secondly, she tells Shoya that Kazuki and Keisuke were the ones that saved him from the river after he fell. She admits to the fact that they all tried to erase their friendship. Tried to forget the past and act like they never even knew Shoya. And then she delivers what might be her most important line, “I’m sorry Shoya.” A simple apology. Something the old Naoka would never have done. Last time she was told to apologize, it was to Shoko, and she ended up harassing her again. Naoka, even if she still maintains her attitude and makes some bad decisions, has grown. She’s gained perspective and clarity on a lot of the past, and with that perspective has begun working to improve herself. She’s nowhere near the point at which Shoya has gotten to, because she's working at her own pace. Everybody heals at their own speed and in their own way, and Naoka’s just happens to be a little slower. She admits to her all her wrongdoings and her feeling of self hatred. The first step to growth. As readers we never get to see the culmination of Naoka’s healing, but I’m sure that it leads her on a similar journey to Shoya. One of self-acceptance and forgiveness. Finding the strength to not ignore the past, not mull over it, but to acknowledge it and use its teaching to improve oneself in the present.</p>
<p>Naoka, in reference to Shoko, tells Shoya that she “I can’t bring myself to like her. I don’t want to like her.” In response, Shoya reflects on his own relationship with Kazuki, and the gap between them, saying “It feels that I could overcome that whenever.” Broken relationships and grudges are so often the result of miscommunication or a failure to communicate in the first place. Shoya acknowledges that those gaps are there, I’m sure there’s someone in your own life who you wish you still had a relationship with, but he realizes the fact that those gaps aren’t insurmountable. Sometimes a simple phone call or coincidental encounter is all it takes to repair years of separation. After all, relationships have no physical measure, no ruleset telling each person how to behave. They are simply the product of interaction and connection, and when that connection is broken, it takes input and effort to repair it. Nothing is ever truly lost, some relationships may explode, or break, but with enough honest disclosure from both sides, they can all be repaired.</p>
<p>Shoya then delivers his final piece of advice to Noaka, the piece of advice that I think speaks to the Naoka in us all, the parts of ourselves that we don’t like, that we’re afraid to acknowledge and the one’s stubborn enough to stay around for years. Sliding themselves into our self-esteem and thought processes, until they feel just as permanent as any other aspect of your personality. The demons that we feel we can’t escape, the ones that hurt ourselves and the people around us. But Shoya shows that that isn’t true, he says, “I think you’re fine the way you are, Noaka. The motivation will present itself when the time’s right. What you like and what you don’t isn’t everything. Plus, we still have plenty of time. I’ll do my best too.” He tells her the honest truth: that wherever you are right now, that’s okay, that’s where you’re supposed to be. Even if that feels wrong, or behind your peers, it’s what’s right for you in that moment, and that’s all that matters. Change isn’t something that can be forced. It’s an arduous process that requires a lot of introspection and effort. But sometimes there’s no need to change immediately. Sometimes we just need to be. Be us, be who we want to be, and be who we are. Sometimes, that’s okay, that’s all you need. The world may feel like it’s pushing you onto the next thing at all times, but stopping, slowing down, and just existing is fine too. In the last couple years especially, people have started to push this ideal of working at all times. Working towards your goals, your career, grinding until the wheels fall off. But I don’t think that’s necessarily the answer. Maybe it is for some people, and if that’s you, then great. But for the rest of us, I think it might be time for a break. To just let it rain for a while. Let the water wash over you, let your feelings sit where they’re supposed to. Acknowledge that maybe yeah, I’m not the exact version of myself that I want to be, but there isn’t any rush to get there. You've got an entire lifetime to figure out who you want to be. Who would we be to believe that an entire life’s work of progress and change should all happen at once because the world wants you to be as perfect as possible. No, fuck the world. Be you. What Shoya says, and what I’m trying to get across here is this: whoever you are right now, whether you’re proud of that person or not, is the right version of yourself. Flaws and all. It’s okay to feel like Naoka. To be angry at the mind that drives your every move. But what matters is feeling those feelings and putting your best foot forward every day to try and find what the person that you actually want to be. “The motivation will present itself when the time is right.” Just wait around, feel who you are, and when that motivation comes, go out there and forge ahead in whatever way feels right. I’m sure at the end of that path we’ll all be able to look back and be proud of the person we’ve become, because whatever we become is just fine.</p>
<p>Naoka leaves the last thing Shoya doesn’t know up to his interpretation: the obvious fact that she loves him. He still doesn’t realize it, but that’s just who he is. And Noaka is able to realize that fact and move forward in her own life not held back by her feelings for Shoya anymore. The scene ends with a panel of a footprint. A footprint that I think represents the print that we leave on the lives of everyone around us. The size of that footprint differs depending on the person. For some we’re just a light in a window, to others a life changing force that sets us on a new path without even realizing it. The time spent to make that effect can be dramatically different. Some people come into our lives, teach us something about ourselves and the world and leave. Others stick around for its remainder. But no matter how long they were there, their footprints will remain forever. We each carry thousands of footprints on our own lives, and have left thousands on the lives of others. All we can do is be grateful for those footprints and the time we get to spend with the people around us. It never hurts to think about some of the footprints people have left of your life, and tell them thanks for all the impacts they’ve had on you. If you’ve even read a word of this essay, know that you’ve left a footprint in my life. One that I’ll never forget. Thanks.</p>
<p>Shoya tells Shoko his plans to pursue his own career in hairdressing, which she happily supports. Finding their own separate, but linked resolves from one another. They may be repeated once Shoko gives off to Tokyo, but they’ll never truly be apart. They both still are thinking about each other, and silently giving the other to keep fighting through the struggles. And in my favorite Oima artwork, Yuzuru snaps a photo of the two of them smiling at one another, and says “good luck, you two.” Facing the future not with fear, but with excitement, knowing that the people around you will never cease to keep supporting you. I feel like this panel expresses their love better than any other. Not through any explicit words or moments, but by the simple fact of how happy they are in one another’s presence. Find people in your own life that make you smile as bright as these two smile at each other, because when you feel that happiness, no one can take it away from you.</p>
<p>We get our wrap up of the second to last chapter with a little montage of the end of the school year, along with Shoya continuing to fail to express his romantic feelings for Shoko out of pure obliviousness. There’s a lot of small things tied into this little part. The use of the calendar refers back to the very beginning, acting as a contrast to the torn one he had at the beginning of the series. Signaling Shoya’s freedom from his suicidal idealogy and focus on the present and future of his life rather than the past. Shoko also uses her patented “see you” peace sign, wrapping up the confusion that sat around it for so much of the story. It was initially confusing for Shoya, and then she used it as a escape tactic before her suicide attempt, but here it’s used in honesty, showing Shoko’s own resolve for the future as well. She also finally explains what the gift she gave him is used for. A symbol for their connection. What previously stood for a symbol of their inability to communicate and understand one another, is now used to signify a mutual trust and connection between the two. There are no longer any restrictions on their ability to face one another, and that leads to more honest conversations and interactions. Strengthening their bond and decreasing the walls between them to almost nothing. And finally, the chapter wraps with Shoya looking forward to speaking to Kazuki at the coming of age ceremony. He says, “I want to talk to him. For real this time.” Shoya is unburdened by his past, and having the clarity to live with it, he seeks to reconnect with it and be genuine with the people that inhabited it. Where he previously ran at the sight of Kazuki, he now looks forward to speaking honestly with him. Something that previously seemed impossible, further cementing Shoya’s growth and comfortability with his current form.</p>
<p>Final chapter: A Silent Voice, it bears the same name of the series that it brings to a close. It’s a chapter of closure. There’s not much that’s new here. It’s just a fun wrap on all the friends made along the way. Each of the cast gets their own little moments. From Pedro to Shoko, really no one is forgotten. It’s another thing that I love about the series. The end feels in no way rushed. There’s no lingering plot points or conflicts yet to be resolved. And if there is, they’re very intentional ones that are meant to signify a character’s continued growth beyond the story’s conclusion. It’s a chapter that simply makes me smile. The artwork is beautiful, its pacing is slow enough to give breath to each of the features, and Shoko and Shoya get the amazing spotlight that they deserve.</p>
<p>There’s really only two moments, besides the very end, that I want to touch on. The first comes when Shoya asks Yaeko what Shoko is going to do for work. She tells him “Don’t ask me. That’s her decision.” Yaeko’s character arc is one the most dramatic in the story. The once overbearing, protective, and controlling mother now lets her children make their own decision for their own happiness. At no point in the story does she ever feel like a bad person, her intentions are very clear, but often misguided. I love this little comment because it shows how much she has changed, even if she was never a main focus of the narrative. Everyone in this story has their own journey, each expressed uniquely, and here's has slowly become one of my favorites over the course of writing this.</p>
<p>The second moment I wanted to focus is even smaller than the first. It happens when the male and female friend groups see each other in the auditorium. Shoko signals something to Shoya to which Noaka yells “STOP FLIRTING.” It’s a funny moment and one that shows that Naoka is still the same girl she was four years ago. But it also says something beyond her words. The fact that Naoka was able to understand what she said means that she’s been learning sign language. It’s another small indicator of character growth and proof that Naoka has been undergoing her own journey of self-improvement during the four years between her last appearance and the coming of age ceremony. Earlier in the story, Naoka criticized Shoya learning sign language as some attempt at trying to make up for his past. But here, Naoka shows that she’s changed on that opinion, working to better herself for the people around her. And taking the first steps to trying to connect with Shoko and forgive her. Sitting at the end of this essay, I really feel like Naoka is the best character in the story. I love her journey so much. It’s been an absolute joy tearing all her small moments and gestures apart looking for clues. There’s so much of her character hidden behind small details, and to me that shows the love that Oima has for her too. Beyond the two main characters, her story undoubtedly has the most thought behind it. And by leaving it partly open ended, it signals to us all that we can change. No matter how many bad things she’s done, Naoka still makes the effort to be better. Showing that no one is irredeemable, and that with the right mindset, anyone can change.</p>
<p>And now, the end. The final scene of this 62 chapter journey. It’s hard for me to put it all on paper. I think I’ve already said so much of what I want to convey for this scene. In a small way I feel like it’s best to just let Shoya tell it. “Back in middle school, I imagined a boring future awaiting me. But now, even that future looks bright to me. You might get sick of how wholesome and full of hope it is. Just like how I used to hate Shoko, whatever is on the other side of this door, is probably from my painful past. But there’s more than that. There are possibilities. And I can open those doors at any time, as long as I’m alive.” I think maybe I’ve been a little too wholesome and hopeful across the scope of this essay as well, but I think if this story has taught me anything, that’s okay. What Shoya tells the reader in his final monologue is simple. He offers the idea that even if what faces him in the future is scary, there’s joy to be found in that process. Shoya has learned to face his life at face value. Not letting the pressures of the past or future cloud his judgement. He’s learned that being alive is enough. That nothing can take that away from him: the irreplaceable and special life that he’s been granted. With the love of the people around him, nothing is impossible. No challenge is too great as long as he keeps breathing.</p>
<p>The chapter and series end as Shoya takes Shoko’s hand and opens the door to not only his past, but his future. There’s immediate significance in them holding hands. I’ve touched on it throughout the essay, but in these final moments, the story finally resolves Shoko’s fear of taking Shoya’s hand: that disconnect between them is truly severed with a sense of finality. To me, this is the narrative’s way of confirming that they’ll spend the rest of their lives together. This isn’t really a romance series, but it’s obviously underlaid with those feelings. This is that final confirmation to the reader that these two do love one another, even if it’s never explicitly stated. And once again, the white light engulfs them as they forge into the future together. No matter what challenges or opportunities await, if they face them together, they’ll always find a way forward.</p>
<p>Shoya’s journey is not one of quiet self-improvement, but of redemption through the people around him. By finding a support system that loves and values him, Shoya is able to overcome his past and find the courage to face the future. With the help of Shoko and his friends, he evolves into something greater. A more empathetic, thoughtful, and complete human. A Shoya that not only he, but we as readers can be proud of. Someone we can look up to. Somebody who’s human to a fault: flawed enough to relate to, but strong enough that we can see our own personal growth reflected in his story. Shoya is the person we all strive to become.</p>
<p>And here, in the story’s final moments, we see that strength is not defined by numbers or singular achievements, but by the ability to face life honestly with the help of others. Cementing Koe no Katachi’s final message: that life isn’t about erasing the past, but learning from it; and finding the ability to live in the joys of the present, alongside the people we love, no matter the hardships.</p>
<p>“I wanted to read one last thing to you. It’s actually something a good friend has wrote describing my world. It says:</p>
<p>‘The caterpillar is a prisoner to the streets that conceived it</p>
<p>Its only job is to eat or consume everything around it, in order to protect itself from this mad city</p>
<p>While consuming its environment the caterpillar begins to notice ways to survive</p>
<p>One thing it noticed is how much the world shuns him, but praises the butterfly</p>
<p>The butterfly represents the talent, the thoughtfulness, and the beauty within the caterpillar</p>
<p>But having a harsh outlook on life the caterpillar sees the butterfly as weak and figures out a way to pimp it to his own benefits</p>
<p>Already surrounded by this mad city the caterpillar goes to work on the cocoon, which institutionalizes him</p>
<p>He can no longer see past his own thoughts</p>
<p>He’s trapped</p>
<p>When trapped inside these walls certain ideas take root, such as going home, and bringing back new concepts to this mad city</p>
<p>The result?</p>
<p>Wings begin to emerge, breaking the cycle of feeling stagnant</p>
<p>Finally free, the butterfly sheds light on situations that the caterpillar never considered, ending the internal struggle</p>
<p>Although the butterfly and caterpillar are completely different, they are one and the same.’</p>
<p>What’s your perspective on that?”</p>
<p>So huh, I guess that’s it. I was going to do an entire explanation of how this poem aligns with not only Kendrick’s journey but Shoya’s as well. But I think if you’ve made this far, I’ll leave the revelation of its alignment to you. It’s one that legitimately brought me to tears when I saw it, and the entire reason I decided to include <em>To Pimp a Butterfly</em> in this essay at all. They’re two stories that I love, and I hope that I’ve done either of them even a semblance of justice.</p>
<p>I think, funnily enough as I began to come close to wrapping this essay up, I realized that the poem applied to myself as well. From the day I started to this to today, my life has dramatically changed. I don’t say that to be all pretentious and act like writing this changed my life, but a wild combination of outside factors have pushed my life into something I never would have expected when I got the idea to write this. I’ve made friends, lost them, had the highest of highs, and hit quite possibly my lowest low. I don’t mean to be corny when I write any of that, I genuinely mean it. So looking back, was I able to become the butterfly that we all wish to emerge on our journeys? I think at some point I did, but in what makes the poem so beautiful, I’ve started out as the caterpillar all over again on a new journey. Renewed with the strength of my last metamorphosis ready to face the next one. I won’t dive into all the details because this just isn’t the place for that, but think about how the poem might apply in your own life. I think we can all learn something from it, and be just a little kinder to ourselves in the process.</p>
<p>Looking back, I’ve waited so long for this moment. Anticipating the day I’d get to write out all my feelings once I was done going over the story, but sitting here I’m not sure what to say. This story means everything to me. I’ve met friends I love more than any others in the process of writing this. I’ve graduated from high school. In every way possible, this has been the background of my life for the past four months. It’s been one of the joys of my life to make this. As of now, what I consider to be the greatest thing I’ve ever made. A labor of love so insane that most people will probably think I’m psychotic if I ever tell them its length. But I couldn’t be prouder. Countless hours, reading, writing, brainstorming, reviewing and redoing it all over again. Is it perfect? Absolutely not. I could go through a laundry list of issues, especially with the beginning, but it feels untrue to not only myself, but the essay to go back and change it. That was how I felt at the moment, so that’s what should be left on the page. I’ve changed so much over the course of this essay. Mentally I’ve developed, hopefully in a good way, and my writing style has likely slightly altered as well. I mean this is probably longer than my previous 18 years of writing experience combined.</p>
<p>I still don’t think I’m a good writer. Not even half-decent. I’ve struggled so much over the course of this to get my thoughts onto the paper. It’s why I’ve pulled so many quotes, trying to draw from everything I’ve loved to capture what I feel. This is more personal than anything I’ve ever done. It pulls from almost everything that I love. Pro wrestling, Kendrick, Etika, Outer Wilds, Youtube, the list can go on forever. I used every resource and piece of media that I’ve ever loved to make this. To make something that I think explains just a tiny bit how great of a story <em>Koe no Katachi</em> is and why I love it so much.</p>
<p>I hope you’ve learned even just a little something new about the story, about me, or about yourself. Because through the process of writing this, I’ve learned more about myself than I ever could have imagined some random film I impulsively watched could have. I meant it when I said that this was the most important story I’ve ever encountered, and honestly I don’t know if any other story will ever have this kind of impact on me again. It’s changed me forever in ways that are difficult to quantify. I’d like to send so many thanks to Yoshitoki Oima for creating this masterpiece. It’s brought me closer to not only the people around me, but to myself as well.</p>
<p>So, standing at the end of my senior year, the end of this essay, the end of my largest creative effort, and the end of what has been a tumultuous and transformative 128 days, I ask myself “have I really changed?” The answer: I’m not sure. Maybe it’s time I listen to Shoya’s advice and focus more on the time I’ve spent trying to change, rather than the physical results. We’re all trying to improve ourselves in our own ways, sometimes it’s positive, other times not so much, but what I can say is that I’m proud to have made an effort in the first place. I’m thankful to the people that’ve stood around me during this time, lifted me up, and enabled me to make the effort towards a self that I feel comfortable living inside of. To most of them, it likely goes unrecognized. Another chance encounter, a small expression of gratitude, but to me it makes all the difference. If you’ve even read a single word of this essay, I’m forever grateful. Thanks for taking a dive into not only this manga, but me as well. I feel like this has come out as not only an analysis of the story, but as a representation of the way that I view the world and the way that influences how I consume media.</p>
<p>Thanks for sticking along for the insanity that has been this entire project. I never imagined when I started it that I’d still be writing it so many months later. Go make a piece of art that fulfills you as much as this did for me. I’ve never been prouder of something I’ve created. I think it speaks to the ever powerful nature of art. To put your soul into something. Give it every last bit of your conscience. And then be able to look at it in physical form and be content with your own creation.</p>
<p>And with that, I think this is just about over. If <em>Koe no Katachi</em> has taught me anything over the years, it’s to be okay with your mistakes. Let them breathe. Give them space to shape you, but not damage you. Then use that space to build a more caring, kind, and complete version of yourself. And always remember: there is no final theory of you. Just a series of moments, memories, media, and people pulling you in different directions, until one day you look back and feel proud of who you are and where you came from.</p>
<p>Thank you so much for reading</p>
<p>Thanks to all the friends and family that’ve supported me throughout this process</p>
<p>Special thanks to Cecelia for helping me with some details and allowing me to use her as a reference. (This essay has oddly always felt tied to you in some way)</p>
<p>Take care of yourselves and of course, as usual, please have yourself a damn good one</p>
<p>For Desmond</p>
