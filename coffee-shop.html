        <h2>Thinking About the Coffee Shop</h2>
        <h3>11.07.25</h3>
        <p>The second you stop and think in this city, just sit and let the environment around you envelop you, you’re stuck with a feeling almost
             un-findable in a place that isn’t occupied by so many thousands. Every person who steps through the door at that coffee shop has their
            own
            shit going on. Their own life worries and troubles are just as complex if not more complex than your own. Some know it as sonder, but when
            it stares you in the face it’s tough to put words on. The guy pacing outside the door getting ready for whatever interaction he just had
            in this place. Did that mean something to him? Was that a big moment that I failed to notice? Maybe he’s been waiting and dreading that
            moment for 5 years, I don’t know. I don’t know him and never will. And why is the employee here so miserable? What does she have going on?
            Everyone here feels so out of reach. It’s like we live together in this place, but if I were to go up to any of them and talk to them,
            would they really be genuine people?</p>
            <p>Honestly, it feels like the answer is no. The human mind can’t comprehend that many different lives
            are as complex as our own. And what was that? These two people just ran into each and they didn’t know they’d both be here. Like
            everyone’s lives seem to intersect but that intersection sometimes only lasts for a moment. Everything here keeps moving, it’s so hard to
            savor the space when everything around you drives 1000 miles per hour. I think it just makes you thankful for what you do have.
            The endless series of innocuous decisions that’ve led you to some place you never thought you’d be sitting next to people you’ll never
            meet again. I think that at the end of all of this, maybe these little interactions and intersections don’t really mean much of anything.
            I think the fact that they smile when they see each other is enough. I might not understand and maybe we don’t all feel that happy at this
            moment, but for now, I think that’s okay. I think that each moment is to be cherished for how different they all are. Sometimes I wish
            this place would slow down, sometimes I wish it would speed up, and sometimes I wish it would just disappear. But maybe that’s not what I
            need. Maybe this friction is what I need. That millions of lives intersect here every moment, but I’m lucky because I get to share that
            intersection with the one life out of those millions that I love the most. </p>
                <p>Maybe I could change the entire course of my life if I struck
            up a conversation with the people to my right, or maybe it’d be nothing. I can’t tell you that now. All I can say is that I’m thankful
            to be here, even just for this moment. “You can’t turn back time”, but maybe we don’t need to. Because the now is all we really need. The
            now is where we’re meant to be, and as long as I know you’re out there, then everything is okay. I’m sure there’s more intersections to
            come, more strangers I’m yet to love. But at this moment, I’m not concerned with that. Because I think realizing how special it is to be
            surrounded by so many stories is what makes this all special. It’s what gives meaning to this little stumbling around, this attempt at
            being someone, something that makes sense. I don’t think any of us will ever make sense, we’ve all got our luggage, we’ve all got our
            stories, our reasons, our person, our own lives. And maybe in yours I’m just a passerby or the kid in the corner typing on his laptop in
            the coffee shop. But I think I’m okay with that. I think everyone’s story can only have so many characters. That we need to cherish,
            nurture, and develop the lives we do have an impact on rather than wondering what all the ones surrounding you may be like. But maybe
            their story is a step to our own, or maybe we’re here alone, and that’s okay too. Because we’re all writing just a small portion in a
            story so large we could never really understand where it’s actually going. So even if it’s scary I’m going to take the next step forward,
            no matter how small it is, because I have a small reason, a little thing that keeps me alive, and I don’t think we need any more than
            that. So I invite you to join, let’s keep going forward, never giving up, chasing the next little light, the next reason, because at the
            end of the day, that’s all we have. It’s just me and you at the end of the world. So let’s go live it. I love you</p>
